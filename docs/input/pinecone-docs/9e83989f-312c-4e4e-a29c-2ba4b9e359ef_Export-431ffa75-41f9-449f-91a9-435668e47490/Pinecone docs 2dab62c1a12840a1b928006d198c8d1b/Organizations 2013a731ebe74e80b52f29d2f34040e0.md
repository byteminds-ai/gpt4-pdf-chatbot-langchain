# Organizations

In Pinecone, an organization is a group of users and resources that share a common set of permissions and access controls. Organizations are useful for managing and organizing teams and projects within Pinecone.

## Creating an organization

To create an organization in Pinecone, you must have an administrator account with the necessary permissions. Once you have an administrator account, you can create a new organization using the Pinecone console.

When creating an organization, you must provide a name and optional description for the organization. You can also choose to invite other users to join the organization and assign them roles and permissions.

## Managing users and permissions

Once you have created an organization, you can manage users and permissions using the Pinecone console. You can invite users to join the organization and assign them roles and permissions based on their responsibilities and needs.

Pinecone supports the following roles:

- **Owner**: The owner has full administrative control over the organization and can manage users and resources.
- **Administrator**: The administrator can manage users and resources within the organization, but cannot modify the organization's settings or delete the organization.
- **Member**: The member can access and modify resources within the organization, but cannot manage users or resources or modify the organization's settings.

You can assign roles and permissions at the organization level, as well as at the resource level (e.g., index-level permissions).
