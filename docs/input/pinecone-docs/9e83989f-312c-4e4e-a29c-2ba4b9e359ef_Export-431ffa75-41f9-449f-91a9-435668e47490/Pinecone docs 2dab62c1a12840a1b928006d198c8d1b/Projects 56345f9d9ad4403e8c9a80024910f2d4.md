# Projects

In Pinecone, a project is a container for indexes, collections, and other resources related to a specific use case or application. Projects are useful for organizing and managing your Pinecone resources, especially if you have multiple indexes or collections.

## Creating a project

To create a project in Pinecone, you can use the Pinecone console or the API. When creating a project, you must provide a name and optional description for the project.

## Managing resources in a project

Once you have created a project, you can add indexes, collections, and other resources to the project. You can also assign permissions to users or organizations for the project and its resources.

Pinecone supports role-based access control (RBAC), which allows you to assign roles and permissions to users or organizations based on their responsibilities and needs. You can assign roles and permissions at the project level, as well as at the resource level (e.g., index-level permissions).

## Listing projects

To list all projects in your Pinecone instance, you can use the Pinecone console or the API. This will return a list of all projects, including their name, description, and owner.

To list the resources in a specific project, you can use the Pinecone console or the API. This will return a list of all resources in the project, including indexes, collections, and other resources.
