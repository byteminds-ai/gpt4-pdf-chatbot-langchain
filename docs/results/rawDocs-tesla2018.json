We are the world’s first vertically integrated sustainable energy company, offering end-to-\nend clean energy products, including generation, storage and consumption. We have established and continue to grow a global network of stores, galleries,\nvehicle service centers, Mobile Service technicians, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our\nproducts, and we continue to develop self-driving capability in order to improve vehicle safety. Our sustainable energy products, engineering expertise,\nintense focus to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, and business model differentiate us from other companies. \nWe currently produce and sell three fully electric vehicles: the Model S sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) and the Model 3 sedan. All\nof our vehicles offer high performance and functionality as well as attractive styling.\nWe commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and have continued to improve Model S by introducing performance, all-wheel drive dual motor,\nand Autopilot options, as well as free over-the-air software updates. We commenced deliveries of Model X in September 2015. Model X offers seating for up\nto seven people, all-wheel drive, and our Autopilot functionality. We commenced deliveries of Model 3, a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market,\nin July 2017, and we have significantly ramped its production. We are now embarking on the delivery of Model 3 in international markets and are focusing\non lowering manufacturing costs while continuing to increase its production rate.\nWe also intend to bring additional all-electric vehicles to market in the future, including \nModel Y, the Tesla Semi truck, a pickup truck and a new\nversion of the Tesla Roadster\n. The production of fully electric vehicles that meet consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design,\nengineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles. Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical\nadvancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop electric vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and\nperformance issues that have historically limited broad adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, our customers enjoy several benefits, including:\n \n•\nLong Range and Recharging Flexibility\n. Our vehicles offer ranges that significantly exceed those of any other commercially available\nelectric vehicle. In addition, our vehicles incorporate our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any\navailable electrical outlet, and also offer fast charging capability from our proprietary Supercharger network.\n \n•\nHigh-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality\n. Our vehicles deliver instantaneous and sustained acceleration, an\nadvanced Autopilot system with active safety and convenience features, and over-the-air software updates.\n \n•\nEnergy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership\n. Our vehicles offer an attractive cost of ownership compared to internal combustion engine or\nhybrid electric vehicles. Using only an electric powertrain enables us to create more energy-efficient vehicles that are mechanically simpler\nthan currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles. The cost to charge our vehicles is less compared to fueling internal\ncombustion vehicles. We also expect our electric vehicles will have lower relative maintenance costs than other vehicles due to fewer\nmoving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves.\nWe sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally. The benefits we receive from distribution\nownership enable us to improve the overall customer experience, the speed of product development and the capital efficiency of our business. We are also\ncontinuing to build our network of Superchargers and Destination Chargers in North America, Europe and Asia to provide alternative convenient options for\nfast charging.\n1","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":4}}},{"pageContent":" \nIn addition, we are leveraging our technological expertise in batteries, power electronics, and integrated systems to manufacture and sell energy\nstorage products. In late 2016, we began production and deliveries of our latest generation energy storage products, Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2. Powerwall\n2 is a 14 kilowatt hour (“kWh”) home battery with an integrated inverter. Powerpack 2 is an infinitely scalable energy storage system for commercial,\nindustrial and utility applications, comprised of up to 210 kWh (AC) battery packs and up to 650 kVa (at 480V) inverters. Similar to our electric vehicles, our\nenergy storage products have been developed to receive over-the-air firmware and software updates that enable additional features over time.\nFinally, we sell and lease solar energy systems (with or without accompanying energy storage systems) to residential and commercial customers and\nsell renewable energy to residential and commercial customers at prices that are typically below utility rates. Since 2006, we have installed solar energy\nsystems for hundreds of thousands of customers. However, the electricity produced by our solar installations represents a very small fraction of total U.S.\nelectricity generation. With tens of millions of single-family homes and businesses in our primary service territories, and many more in other locations, we\nhave a large opportunity to expand and grow this business. We believe that residential solar energy generation is gaining momentum, as exemplified in part\nby the state of California recently requiring that new homes be built with solar generation starting in 2020. We also intend to ramp production of our\ninnovative Solar Roof product.\nWe manufacture our vehicle products primarily at our facilities in Fremont, California, Lathrop, California, Tilburg, Netherlands and at our\nGigafactory 1 near Reno, Nevada. We manufacture our energy storage products at Gigafactory 1 and Tesla solar products at our U.S. facilities including in\nBuffalo, New York (Gigafactory 2). In January 2019, we began construction of our Gigafactory Shanghai in China, where we intend to commence production\nof certain trims of Model 3 for the local market by the end of 2019.\nOur Products and Services\nVehicles\nModel S\nModel S is a fully electric, four-door, five-adult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and high performance and our all-wheel drive dual\nmotor system, which we also offer in a performance version. Model S 100D is the longest range all-electric production sedan in the world, and the\nperformance version with the Ludicrous speed upgrade is the quickest accelerating production vehicle available.\nModel S introduced a 17 inch touch screen driver interface, our advanced Autopilot hardware to enable both active safety and convenience features,\nand over-the-air software updates. We believe the combination of performance, safety, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S positions it as a\ncompelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments.\nModel X\nModel X is the longest range all-electric production sport utility vehicle in the world, and offers high performance features such as our fully electric,\nall-wheel drive dual motor system and our Autopilot system. Model X can seat up to seven adults and incorporates a unique falcon wing door system for easy\naccess to the second and third seating rows. Model X is sold in all markets where Model S is available.\nModel 3\nModel 3 is our third generation electric vehicle, which we began delivering in July 2017. Model 3 and its drive units are currently produced at high\nvolumes at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California and at Gigafactory 1, respectively, and we intend to begin \nproduction of certain vehicle trims for China at\nour Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019\n. We have offered a number of variants of Model 3, including performance, dual motor, single motor, long-range\nand medium-range, and intend to offer in the future a variant of Model 3 at a starting price of $35,000. We are now embarking on the delivery of Model 3 in\ninternational markets and are focusing on lowering manufacturing costs while continuing to increase its production rate.\n2","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":5}}},{"pageContent":" \nFuture Consumer and Commercial EVs\nIn addition to our volume-produced consumer EVs, including future vehicles such as Model Y and a pickup truck, we are planning to introduce\nadditional types of vehicles to address a broader cross-section of the vehicle market, including commercial EVs such as the Tesla Semi truck, and a new\nversion of the Tesla Roadster. We have started to accept reservations for the Tesla Semi truck and the new Tesla Roadster.\nEnergy Storage\nUsing the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems, we developed energy\nstorage products for use in homes, commercial facilities and on the utility grid. Advances in battery architecture, thermal management and power electronics\nthat were originally commercialized in our vehicles are now being leveraged in our energy storage products. Our energy storage systems are used for\nnumerous applications including backup power, grid independence, peak demand reduction, demand response, reducing intermittency of renewable\ngeneration, replacement of fossil fuel generation and wholesale electric market services.\nOur energy product portfolio includes systems with a wide range of applications, from residential to large grid-scale projects. Powerwall 2 is a 14\nkWh rechargeable lithium-ion battery designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility and can be used to provide seamless backup power in a\ngrid outage and to maximize self-consumption of solar power generation. In addition, we offer the Powerpack 2 system, a fully integrated energy storage\nsolution comprised of up to 210kWh (AC) battery packs and up to 650 kVa (at 480V) inverters that can be grouped together to form megawatt hour (“MWh”)\nand gigawatt hour (“GWh”) sized installations. The Powerpack 2 system can be used by commercial and industrial customers for peak shaving, load shifting,\nself-consumption of solar generation and demand response, as well as to provide backup power during grid outages, and by utilities and independent power\nproducers to smooth and firm the output of renewable power generation sources, provide dynamic energy capacity to the grid, defer or eliminate the need to\nupgrade transmission or distribution infrastructure, and provide a variety of other grid services such as frequency regulation and voltage control. Powerpack 2\ncan also be combined with renewable energy generation sources to create microgrids that provide communities with clean, resilient and affordable power.\nAlong with designing and manufacturing energy storage products, we continue to develop and advance our software capabilities for the control and\noptimal dispatch of energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications.\nSolar Energy Systems\nThe major components of our solar energy systems include solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical current, inverters that convert the\nelectrical output from the panels to a usable current compatible with the electric grid, racking that attaches the solar panels to the roof or ground, electrical\nhardware that connects the solar energy system to the electric grid, and our monitoring device. While we have recently started manufacturing solar panels at\nGigafactory 2 in collaboration with Panasonic, we currently purchase the majority of system components from vendors, maintaining multiple sources for each\nmajor component to ensure competitive pricing and an adequate supply of materials. We also design and manufacture other system components.\nThe residential solar energy systems that we sell enable our customers to take direct advantage of federal tax credits to reduce their electricity costs.\nOur solar loan offering enables customers to own their solar energy systems with little upfront cost. We also continue to offer lease and power purchase\nagreement (“PPA”) options to both residential and commercial customers. Our current standard leases and PPAs have a 20-year term, and we typically offer\ncustomers the opportunity to renew their agreements.\nIn October 2016, we unveiled Solar Roof, which integrates solar energy production with aesthetically pleasing and durable glass roofing tiles and is\ndesigned to complement the architecture of homes and commercial buildings while turning sunlight into electricity. We have been installing this product at a\nslow pace to gather learnings about our design and installation processes, and plan to ramp the production of Solar Roof with significantly improved\nmanufacturing capabilities during 2019.\n3","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":6}}},{"pageContent":" \nTechnology\nVehicles\nOur core competencies are powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage. Our core intellectual property\nincludes our electric powertrain, our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain and our development of self-\ndriving technologies. Our powertrain consists of our battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and control software. We offer several powertrain\nvariants for our vehicles that incorporate years of research and development. In addition, we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in\nconsumer technologies, such as mobile computing, sensing, displays, and connectivity.\nBattery Pack\nWe design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety, reliability and long life. Our proprietary\ntechnology includes systems for high density energy storage, cooling, safety, charge balancing, structural durability, and electronics management. We have\nalso pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs with high quality at low cost.\nWe have significant expertise in the safety and management systems needed to use lithium-ion cells in the automotive environment, and have further\noptimized cell designs to increase overall performance. These advancements have enabled us to improve over time the cost and performance of our batteries.\nOur engineering and manufacturing efforts have been performed with a longer-term goal of building a foundation for further development. For\ninstance, we have designed our battery pack to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor. We maintain extensive testing and\nR&D capabilities at the individual cell level, the full battery-pack level and on other critical battery pack systems, and have built an expansive body of\nknowledge on lithium-ion cell vendors, chemistry types, and performance characteristics. We believe that the flexibility of our designs, combined with our\nresearch and real-world performance data, will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells and optimize battery pack system performance and cost for\nour current and future vehicles.\nPower Electronics\nThe power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout our vehicles and serve to power\nour electric motor to generate torque while driving and deliver energy into the battery pack while charging.\nThe drive inverter converts direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive our induction and permanent magnet motors and\nprovides “regenerative braking” functionality, which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack. The primary technological advantages to\nour designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package with high efficiency and low cost.\nThe charger charges the battery pack by converting alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current that\ncan be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger, from a common\nhousehold outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses.\nDual Motor Powertrain\nWe offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration.\nTesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The near-instantaneous response of the motors,\ncombined with low centers of gravity, provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control.\n4","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}},{"pageContent":" \nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in\nour vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. Software algorithms control traction, vehicle stability, the\nacceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle, climate control and thermal management, and are also used extensively to monitor the charge state of\nthe battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize\nvehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the\nuser interfaces, internally.\nSelf-Driving Development\nWe have expertise in developing self-driving systems, and currently offer in our vehicles an advanced driver assist system that we refer to as\nAutopilot, including auto-steering, traffic aware cruise control, automated lane changing, automated parking, Summon and driver warning systems. In\nOctober 2016, we began equipping all Tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full self-driving capability, including cameras that provide 360 degree\nvisibility, updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection, a forward-facing radar with enhanced processing, and a powerful new onboard computer. Our\nAutopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel. Although, at present, the driver is ultimately\nresponsible for controlling the vehicle, our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system\nthat airplane pilots use when conditions permit. This hardware suite, along with over-the-air firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard\ncamera, radar, ultrasonics, and GPS, enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance.\nAdditionally, we continue to make significant advancements in the development of fully self-driving technologies.\nEnergy Storage\nWe are leveraging many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products, including high density\nenergy storage, cooling, safety, charge balancing, structural durability, and electronics management. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery\nsystems, we are able to maximize manufacturing capacity to produce both Powerwall and Powerpack products. Additionally, we are making significant\nstrides in the area of bi-directional, grid-tied power electronics that enable us to interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids\nwhile providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption.\nSolar Energy Systems\nWe are continually innovating and developing new technologies to facilitate the growth of our solar energy systems business. For example, Solar\nRoof is being designed to work seamlessly with Tesla Powerwall 2 and we have developed proprietary software to reduce system design and installation\ntimelines and costs.\nDesign and Engineering\nVehicles\nIn addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and\nengineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage\nelectrical systems in-house, and to a lesser extent, in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test\nsimulations, which reduces the product development time of new models.\n5","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":8}}},{"pageContent":" \nAdditionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range.\nModel S and Model X are built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporate a variety of materials and production methods that help\noptimize the weight of the vehicle.

Our engineers complete a structural\nanalysis of each building and produce a full set of structural design and electrical blueprints that contain the specifications for all system components.\nAdditionally, we design complementary mounting and grounding hardware where required.\nSales and Marketing\nVehicles\nCompany-Owned Stores and Galleries\nWe market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries, which we believe\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer\nfeedback. Our Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets, some of which combine retail sales and service.\nWe have also found that opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand. As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with\nsales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint. We refer to these as “Service Plus” locations.\nUsed Car Sales\nOur used car business supports new car sales by integrating the sale of a new Tesla vehicle with a customer’s trade-in needs for their existing Tesla\nand non-Tesla vehicles. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire through trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third-\nparty auto auctions. We also receive used Tesla vehicles to resell through lease returns and other sources.\nCharging\nWhen not charging at home or at work, Tesla customers can also charge using our Supercharger and Destination Charging networks. In addition, our\nvehicles can charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world, either natively or through a suite of adapters. This flexibility provides our\ncustomers with many charging options to suit various situations.\n6","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":9}}},{"pageContent":" \nWe continue to build out our Tesla Supercharger network throughout North America, Europe, Asia and other markets for our customers’ convenience,\nincluding to enable long-distance travel and urban ownership. Our Supercharger network is a strategic corporate initiative designed to provide publicly\naccessible fast charging solutions, and remove a barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by the perception of limited vehicle range. The\nTesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high speed charger designed to recharge a Tesla vehicle significantly more quickly than other charging options,\nand we continue to evolve our technology to allow for even faster charging times at lower cost to us. To satisfy growing demand, Supercharger stations\ntypically have between six and thirty Superchargers and are strategically placed along well-traveled routes and in dense city centers to allow Tesla vehicle\nowners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient, minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network is either free or requires\na competitive fee.\nWe work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail, and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\ncharging options for our customers. These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle\nowners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also work with single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities to deploy home\ncharging solutions in our communities.\nWhere possible, we are co-locating Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce the cost of electricity and promote the use of\nrenewable electricity by Tesla vehicle owners.  \nOrders\nWe offer our customers the flexibility to order vehicles with their desired trims and options by visiting us online at our website or in person at our\nTesla stores.\nMarketing\nHistorically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so.\nTo date, media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our vehicle sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional\nadvertising and at relatively low marketing costs.\nSolar and Energy Storage\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to individuals, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\nchannels.\nIn the U.S., we have been transitioning the direct sales channel for residential solar and energy storage products from former partners to our stores and\ngalleries. We are also continuing to sell residential energy storage products through our network of channel partners. Outside of the U.S., we use our\ninternational sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell residential energy storage products, and we have recently launched pilot\nprograms for the sale of residential solar in certain countries. We also sell Powerwall 2 directly to utilities, who then deploy the product in customer homes.\nWe sell Powerpack 2 systems to commercial and utility customers through our international sales organization, which consists of experienced energy\nindustry professionals in all of our target markets, as well as through our channel partner network. In the U.S and Mexico, we also sell installed solar energy\nsystems (with or without energy storage) to commercial customers through cash, lease and PPA transactions.\nService and Warranty\nVehicles\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service centers, at our Service Plus locations or through an expanding fleet of\nTesla Mobile Service technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift.

For the battery and drive unit on our current new Model S and Model X vehicles, we offer an eight\nyear, infinite mile limited warranty, although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered. For the battery and drive unit on our current new Model 3\nvehicles, we offer an eight year or 100,000 mile limited warranty for our standard or mid-range battery and an eight year or 120,000 mile limited warranty for\nour long range battery, with minimum 70% retention of battery capacity over the warranty period.\nIn addition to the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, we currently offer for Model S and Model X a comprehensive maintenance program for every new\nvehicle, which includes plans covering prepaid maintenance for up to four years or up to 50,000 miles and an Extended Service plan. The maintenance plans\ncover annual inspections and the replacement of certain wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery. The Extended Service plan covers the repair or\nreplacement of vehicle parts for up to an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles after the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.\nEnergy Storage\nWe generally provide a 10 year “no defect” and “energy retention” warranty with every Powerwall 2 and a 15 year “no defect” and “energy\nretention” warranty with every Powerpack 2 system. For Powerwall 2, the energy retention warranty involves us guaranteeing that the energy capacity of the\nproduct will be 70% or 80% (depending on the region of installation) of its nameplate capacity after 10 years of use. For Powerpack 2, the energy retention\nwarranty involves us guaranteeing a minimum energy capacity in each of its first 15 years of use. For both products, our warranty is subject to specified use\nrestrictions or kWh throughput caps. In addition, we offer certain extended warranties, which customers are able to purchase from us at the time they purchase\nan energy storage system, including a 20 year extended protection plan for Powerwall 2 and a selection of 10 or 20 year performance guarantees for\nPowerpack 2. We agree to repair or replace our energy storage products in the event of a valid warranty claim.  In circumstances where we install a Powerwall\n2 or Powerpack 2 system, we also provide warranties of up to 20 years on our installation workmanship. All of the warranties for our energy storage systems\nare subject to customary limitations and exclusions.\nSolar Energy Systems\nFor traditional solar energy systems, we provide a workmanship warranty for up to 20 years from installation and a separate warranty against roof\nleaks. We also pass-through the inverter and module manufacturer warranties (typically 12 years and 25 years respectively). When we lease a traditional solar\nenergy system, we compensate the customer if their system produces less energy than guaranteed over a specified period. For Solar Roof, we provide a\nwarranty against glass tile chipping or cracking for the lifetime of the home, a 30 year installation warranty, a 30 year weatherization warranty and a power\noutput warranty. For all systems (traditional and Solar Roof) we also provide service and repair (either under warranty or for a fee) during the entire term of the\ncustomer relationship.\nFinancial Services\nVehicles\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions.

Our solar loan offers third-party financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system.\nWe are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to\nthe loan. Our solar lease offers customers a fixed monthly fee, at rates that typically translate into lower monthly utility bills, and an electricity production\nguarantee. Our solar PPA charges customers a fee per kWh based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. We monetize the\ncustomer payments we receive from our leases and PPAs through funds we have formed with investors.

We are also constructing Gigafactory Shanghai, a manufacturing facility in China, for the production of Model 3\nvehicles for the local market.\nManufacturing Facilities in Fremont, CA and Lathrop, CA\nWe manufacture our vehicles, and certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards, at our\nmanufacturing facilities in Fremont, CA, including the Tesla Factory, and our manufacturing facility in Lathrop, CA. Our Fremont facilities contain several\nmanufacturing operations, including stamping, machining, casting, plastics, body assembly, paint operations, drive unit production, seat assembly, final\nvehicle assembly and end-of-line testing. In addition, we manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors, gearboxes and components for Model S and\nModel X at the Tesla Factory. Some major vehicle component systems are purchased from suppliers; however, we have a high level of vertical integration in\nour manufacturing processes at the Tesla Factory.\nThe Netherlands\nOur European headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in Amsterdam and Tilburg. Our operations in Tilburg include final assembly,\ntesting and quality control for Model S and Model X vehicles delivered within the European Union, a parts distribution warehouse for service centers\nthroughout Europe, a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center.\nGigafactory 1 outside of Reno, Nevada\nGigafactory 1 is a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material, cell, module and battery pack production in one\nlocation. We use the battery packs manufactured at Gigafactory 1 for our vehicles, including Model 3, and energy storage products. We also manufacture\nModel 3 drive units at Gigafactory 1.\n9","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":12}}},{"pageContent":" \nGigafactory 1 is being built in phases. Tesla, Panasonic and other partners are currently manufacturing inside the finished sections. Our present plan\nis to continue expanding Gigafactory 1 over the next few years so that its capacity significantly exceeds the approximately 500,000 vehicle per year capacity\nthat we announced when we first started developing it, and we have additionally added capacity for manufacturing our energy storage products. We have also\nannounced that we will likely manufacture Model Y, which we intend to produce at high volumes by the end of 2020, at Gigafactory 1.\nWe believe that Gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs with our volume production of Model\n3. We have an agreement with Panasonic to partner with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it is using to manufacture and\nsupply us with battery cells. Through our ownership of Gigafactory 1 and our partnership with Panasonic, we own sole access to a facility designed to be the\nhighest-volume and lowest-cost source of lithium-ion batteries in the world.\nGigafactory Shanghai\nWe are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing\ntransportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S. We broke ground in January 2019, and subject to a\nnumber of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory\nonline, we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019. We expect much of the investment in\nGigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing, supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us. Moreover, we are targeting the\ncapital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory, from which we have\ndrawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai.\nSupply Chain\nOur vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers. We have developed close relationships with\nseveral key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts. While we obtain components from multiple sources in some\ncases, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. In addition, while\nseveral sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available, we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery\npacks we use in our production vehicles. We are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers.\nWe use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials\nfluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the\nraw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements.\nEnergy Storage\nOur energy storage products are manufactured at Gigafactory 1. We leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we use for our\nvehicles. The battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to those used in our vehicles’\nbattery pack, enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of scale. The power electronics and inverters for the\nPowerwall and Powerpack systems are also manufactured at Gigafactory 1, allowing us to ship deployment-ready systems directly to customers.\n10","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":13}}},{"pageContent":" \nSolar Energy Systems\nWe currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers. We typically purchase solar panels\nand inverters on an as-needed basis from our suppliers at then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contractual arrangements.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a long-term agreement with Panasonic to manufacture photovoltaic (“PV”) cells and modules with negotiated pricing\nprovisions at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York with the intended capacity to manufacture at least 1.0 gigawatt (“GW”) of solar products annually. We\nhave recently started manufacturing solar panels at this facility in collaboration with Panasonic.\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\nVehicles\nCalifornia Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives\nWe have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing\nAuthority (“CAEATFA”) that provide multi-year sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes,\nincluding the expansion and ongoing development of Model S, Model X, Model 3 and future electric vehicles and the expansion of electric vehicle\npowertrain production in California.\nNevada Tax Incentives\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory 1, we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that\nprovide abatements for sales, use, real property, personal property and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax\ncredits. These incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2034\n(depending on the incentive). Under these agreements, we were eligible for a maximum of $195.0 million of transferable tax credits, subject to capital\ninvestments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least $3.50 billion, which we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1,\nwhich we exceeded during 2018. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, we had earned the maximum amount of credits.\nTesla Regulatory Credits\nIn connection with the production, delivery, placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicles, charging infrastructure and\nsolar systems in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to\nsell future credits, to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\nrequirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted California’s standard, vehicle\nmanufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws\nprovide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those\nlaws. Tesla also earns other types of salable regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels\ncredits. Likewise, several U.S. states have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. These requirements enable companies\ndeploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (“SRECs”).\nRegulation—\nVehicle Safety and Testing\nOur vehicles are subject to, and comply with or are otherwise exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). Our vehicles fully\ncomply with all applicable FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions, and we expect future Tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited\nexemptions related to new technologies. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and while we anticipate\ncompliance, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted.\n11","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":14}}},{"pageContent":" \nAs a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt,\nbefore the vehicles can be imported or sold in the U.S. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance\nrequirements, and electric vehicle requirements. We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE\nstandards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty\nclaims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.\nThe Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the\nmanufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as\ndetermined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted.\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are\ndifferent from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. The European Union has established new rules regarding additional\ncompliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s impending\nwithdrawal from the European Union.  These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in Europe.\nRegulation – Self Driving\nThere are no federal U.S. regulations pertaining to the safety of self-driving vehicles; however, NHTSA has established recommended guidelines.\nCertain U.S. states have legal restrictions on self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This patchwork increases the legal complexity\nfor our vehicles. In Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to self-driving braking and steering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the legality\nof certain higher levels of self-driving vehicles. Self-driving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and\nforeign countries, and may create restrictions on self-driving features that we develop.\nRegulation—\nBattery Safety and Testing\nOur battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may\npresent a risk in transportation. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. We have completed the\napplicable transportation tests for our battery packs, demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations.\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs. The use, storage, and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under federal law. We have\nagreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs. \nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\nState laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be\nlicensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state. As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers, we secure dealer licenses (or their\nequivalent) and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers. A few states, such as Michigan and Connecticut, do not permit\nautomobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service\nvehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the Internet, phone or\nmail. In such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and are not sales locations.\nAs we expand our retail footprint in the U.S., some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court\nand used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. We expect\nthat the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model. In addition, we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state\nlicensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and\nservice locations, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles.\n12","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":15}}},{"pageContent":" \nEnergy Storage\nThe regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development. Nevertheless, there are various policies, incentives and financial\nmechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage. For example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar\nenergy are eligible for the 30% tax credit under Section 48(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the IRC, as described below. In addition, California and a\nnumber of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the\nCalifornia Self Generation Incentive Program.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy\nmarkets. In 2011 and 2013, FERC removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service, thus increasing the value\nthese systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets. More recently, in late 2016, FERC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that, if it becomes a final\nrule, would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets. Finally, in January 2017, FERC\nissued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently, thus enabling energy storage\nsystems to provide greater value to the electric grid.\nSolar Energy Systems\nGovernment and Utility Programs and Incentives\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy\nand to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\nThe federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit (“ITC”) under two sections of the IRC: Section 48 and Section 25D.\nSection 48(a)(3) of the IRC allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences\nconstruction by December 31, 2019. The credit then declines to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and a permanent 10% thereafter. We claim the Section 48\ncommercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects, based on ownership of the solar energy system. The federal government\nalso provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems. Section 25D of the IRC allows a homeowner-taxpayer to claim a credit of\n30% of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by December 31, 2019. The credit then\ndeclines to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, and is scheduled to expire thereafter. Customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our\nsolar loan offering are eligible to claim the Section 25D investment tax credit.\nIn addition to the federal ITC, many U.S. states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentives for solar energy systems.\nRegulation – General\nWe are not a “regulated utility” in the U.S. To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities. In most cases,\ninterconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body. \nSales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, face regulatory challenges in some states and\njurisdictions.\nRegulation – Net Metering\nMost states in the U.S. have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically\nallows solar customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill\ncredit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or\neliminated the benefit available under net metering, or have proposed to do so.\n13","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":16}}},{"pageContent":" \nRegulation – Mandated Renewable Capacity\nMany states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production, such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard, or\nRPS, or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible\nrenewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems. In SREC state markets, the RPS requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity\nfrom solar generators. The SREC program provides a means for SRECs to be created. A SREC represents the renewable energy associated with 1,000 kWhs of\nelectricity produced from a solar energy system. When a solar energy system generates 1,000 kWhs of electricity, one SREC is issued by a government\nagency, which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the SRECs to the state to prove compliance with the\nstate’s renewable energy mandate.\nCompetition\nVehicles\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce\nadditional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market.\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion\ntechnology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 competes with small to medium-\nsized sedans, which are extremely competitive markets with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers.\nMoreover, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market.\nOverall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the\nattractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles, particularly those fueled by electricity, relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile\nmanufacturers have electric vehicles available today, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles.\nElectric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the\nU.S. market as well. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. \nEnergy Storage\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive. Established companies, such as AES Energy Storage, Siemens, LG Chem and\nSamsung, as well as various emerging companies, have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio. There are several companies providing\nindividual components of energy storage systems (such as cells, battery modules, and power electronics) as well as others providing integrated systems. We\ncompete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications of our products, our strong brand, and the\nmodular, scalable nature of our Powerpack 2 product give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products.\nSolar Energy Systems\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We\ncompete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity\ngenerated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy\ncompanies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. In the residential solar energy system installation\nmarket, our primary competitors include Vivint Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Trinity Solar, SunPower Corporation, and many smaller local solar companies.\n14","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":17}}},{"pageContent":" \nIntellectual Property\nAs part of our business, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets,\nincluding through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements.

The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, production,\ndelivery and servicing ramp of new vehicles and other products such as Model 3, Model Y, our energy storage products and Solar Roof, which\ncould harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have previously experienced launch, manufacturing, production and delivery ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle\nmodels such as Model S, Model X and Model 3, new vehicle features such as the all-wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on Model S and the second version of\nAutopilot hardware, and a significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture of Model 3. For example, we encountered unanticipated\nchallenges, such as certain supply chain constraints, that led to initial delays in producing Model X. Similarly, we experienced certain challenges in the\nproduction of Model 3 that led to delays in its ramp. Moreover, in the areas of Model 3 production where we had challenges ramping fully automated\nprocesses, such as portions of the battery module assembly line, material flow system and the general assembly line, we reduced the levels of automation and\nintroduced semi-automated or manual processes. If issues like these arise or recur, if our remediation measures and process changes do not continue to be\nsuccessful, if we experience issues with transitioning to full automation in certain production lines or to other planned manufacturing improvements, or if we\nexperience issues or delays in building our Gigafactory Shanghai in China or commencing and ramping Model 3 production there, we could experience\nissues in sustaining the Model 3 ramp or delays in increasing Model 3 production further. Also, if we encounter difficulties in scaling our delivery or\nservicing capabilities for Model 3 or future vehicles and products to high volumes in the U.S. or internationally, our financial condition and operating results\ncould suffer. In addition, because our vehicle models share certain production facilities with other vehicle models, the volume or efficiency of production\nwith respect to one model may impact the production of other models or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production of all models.\nWe may also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles, such as Model\nY, the Tesla Semi, our planned pickup truck and new Tesla Roadster, our energy storage products and Solar Roof. Any significant additional delay or other\ncomplication in the production of and delivery capabilities for our current products or the development, manufacture, launch, production and delivery and\nservicing capability ramp of our future products, including complications associated with expanding our production capacity, supply chain and delivery\nsystems or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays\n in \nrealizing \nour \nprojected timelines\n and\n \ncost\n and\n \nvolume targets for \nthe\nproduction\n and ramp\n of Model 3\n,\n which could harm our business\n,\n prospects\n, financial condition and operating results.\nOur\n future business depends in large part on our\n ability to \nexecute on our plans to manufacture, market and sell the Model 3 vehicle, which we are\noffering at a lower price point and which we are producing at significantly higher volumes than the Model S or Model X vehicles. We commenced\nproduction and initial customer deliveries of Model 3 in July 2017, and since then have achieved a stabilized production rate. \nAt the Tesla Factory, we\nexpect to continue to increase our Model 3 production rate to approximately 7,000 units per week on a sustained basis by the end of 2019. Moreover, in\nChina, we expect to commence production of \ncertain trims of Model 3\n for the local market in China in the initial phase of our Gigafactory Shanghai by the\nend of 2019, and then progressively increase levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing. Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai, our goal is\nto be able to produce 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis, and an annualized output rate in excess of 500,000 Model 3 vehicles sometime\nbetween the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. However, the timeframe for commencing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai is\nsubject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing\nthe factory online.\n16","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":19}}},{"pageContent":" \nWe have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we recently achieved and to which we anticipate ramping\nfurther for Model 3, and to be successful, we will need to\n complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and cost-effective\n manufacturing \ncapabilities,\nprocesses \nand supply chains necessary to support such volumes, including at Gigafactory Shanghai.\n We are employing a higher degree of automation in the\nmanufacturing processes for Model 3 than we have previously employed and to continue to implement additional automation. In some cases, \nwe have\ntemporarily reduced the levels of automation and introduced semi-automated or manual processes\n, at additional labor cost. Additional bottlenecks may also\narise as we continue to ramp production at the Tesla Factory and commence the initial phase of Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai, and it will be\nimportant that we address them promptly and in a cost-effective manner\n. \nMoreover, our Model 3 production plan has generally required to date significant\ninvestments of cash and management resources, and we expect to deploy some level of additional resources as we further progress our ramp and begin\nproduction in new locations in the future, such as China.\nOur production plan for Model 3 is based on many key assumptions, including:\n \n•\nthat we will be able to sustain and further expand our high-volume production of Model 3 at the Tesla Factory without exceeding our\nprojected costs and on our projected timeline;\n \n•\nthat we will be able to continue to expand Gigafactory 1 in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells to be\nintegrated into battery modules and finished battery packs and drive unit components for Model 3, including in part to support production in\nChina as the level of local sourcing and manufacturing there progressively increases, all at costs that allow us to sell Model 3 at our target\ngross margins;\n \n•\nthat we will be able to build and commence production at additional future facilities, such as at Gigafactory Shanghai, to support our\ninternational ramp for Model 3 in accordance with our projected costs and timeline;\n \n•\nthat the equipment and processes which we have selected for Model 3 production will be able to accurately manufacture high volumes of\nModel 3 vehicles within specified design tolerances and with high quality;\n \n•\nthat we will be able to maintain suppliers for the necessary components on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us and that we will be\nable to obtain high-quality components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities to support high-volume production; and\n \n•\nthat we will be able to attract, recruit, hire, train and retain skilled employees to operate our planned high-volume production facilities to\nsupport Model 3, including at the Tesla Factory, Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory Shanghai.\nIf one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect, our ability to meet our Model 3 projections on time and at volumes and prices\nthat are profitable, the demand for and deliveries of Model 3, as well as our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition, may be materially\nand adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production, sales and delivery plans and servicing needs, any of which could harm our business and\nprospects.\nOur plans call for sustaining and further ramping from our significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries, particularly for Model 3. Our\nability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity to achieve the planned\nproduction yield, further install and increase capacity in accordance with our planned timelines and costs, maintain our desired quality levels and optimize\ndesign and production changes, as well as our suppliers’ ability to support our needs. In addition, we have used and may use in the future a number of new\nmanufacturing technologies, techniques and processes for our vehicles, which we must successfully introduce and scale for high-volume production. For\nexample, we have introduced highly automated production lines, aluminum spot welding systems and high-speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp\nvehicle parts. We have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges, such as large display screens, dual\nmotor drivetrain, Autopilot hardware and falcon-wing doors. We have limited experience developing, manufacturing, selling and servicing, and allocating\nour available resources among, multiple products simultaneously.

While we are producing numerous variants (including regional versions) of Model 3 in accordance\nwith the demand that we expect for them, if our projections are inaccurate, we may not be able to generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have\nthe capacity to produce, based on vehicle production line constraints and long lead times for procuring certain parts.\nMoreover, because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers and meeting\ntheir vehicle servicing needs. To date, we have limited experience with such deliveries and servicing at the scale to which we expect to grow, particularly in\ninternational markets. To accommodate our volumes, we have deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces,\nsome of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different geographies. Moreover, significant transit time may be required to transport vehicles\nsuch as Model 3 in volume into new markets for the first time. To the extent that such factors lead to delays in our deliveries, our results may be negatively\nimpacted. Finally, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by our service centers, Mobile Service\ntechnicians or certain authorized professionals that we have specifically trained and equipped. If we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or\nexperience unforeseen issues with the reliability of Model 3, which we recently commenced producing at volume, it could overburden our servicing\ncapabilities. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our sales, delivery and servicing targets globally, or our projections on which such targets are based are\ninaccurate, this could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition\nand operating results.\nOur future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles, especially in the\nmass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3.\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. Although\nwe have successfully grown demand for our vehicles thus far, there is no guarantee of such future demand, or that our vehicles will not compete with one\nanother in the market. Moreover, the Model 3 mass market demographic is larger, but more competitive, than the demographic for Model S and Model X, and\nadditional electric vehicles are entering the market.\nIf the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, or develops more slowly than we expect,\nor if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. We have only\nrecently begun high volume production of vehicles, are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources relative to our competitors, and the market for\nalternative fuel vehicles is rapidly evolving. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be affected by numerous factors, such as:\n \n•\np\nerceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n \n•\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\n \n•\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal\ncombustion engine vehicles;\n \n•\nvolatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n \n•\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives;\n \n•\naccess to charging facilities; and\n \n•\nconcerns about our future viability.\n18","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":21}}},{"pageContent":" \nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary\ncomponents of our products according to our schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently\nmanage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently\nsingle-source suppliers, although we attempt to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible. Any significant increases in our\nproduction may require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time, and in the past\n we have also replaced\n certain suppliers\n because of\ntheir failure to provide components that met our quality control standards.\n While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of\nsupply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for\ncertain highly customized components of our products. Moreover, we have signed long-term agreements with Panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and\nsupplier for lithium-ion cells at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and PV cells and panels at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York. If we encounter unexpected\ndifficulties with key suppliers such as Panasonic, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production delays and\npotential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing, servicing and supporting our products.\nThis limited, and in many cases single source, supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for\nthe production of our products, such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slower-than-planned Model S and Model X\nramps. Furthermore, unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labor issues, wars, governmental changes, natural disasters such as the\nMarch 2011 earthquakes in Japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control, could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us\non a timely basis. \nThe loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product\ndesign changes and delays in product deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity,\ndamage to our brand and a material and adverse effect\n on \nour business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in our supply chain have also resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost. We have also experienced cost increases\nfrom certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to our design changes, and we may experience\nsimilar cost increases in the future. Certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the terms of supply arrangements. Additionally, we are negotiating with\nexisting suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less\nexpensive to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. \nIn particular, because we are producing Model 3 at significantly higher volumes than any of our other products to date, the negative impact of any\ndelays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for Model 3 could be substantially greater than any supply chain-related issues experienced with\nrespect to our other products. We need our Model 3 suppliers to sustainably ramp in accordance with our ongoing ramp of Model 3 and deliver according to\nour schedule. There is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost, quality and volume needs. \nFor\nexample, we may experience issues or delays increasing the level of localization in China through local sourcing and manufacturing at our Gigafactory\nShanghai. Furthermore, as the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport to our\nmanufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our\nactual needs, or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply\nchain, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and operating results.\n19","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":22}}},{"pageContent":" \nFuture problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our\nproducts, such as Model 3 and our energy storage products.\nTo lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume, we have vertically integrated the production of lithium-ion cells and finished\nbattery packs for Model 3 and energy storage products at Gigafactory 1. While Gigafactory 1 began producing lithium-ion cells for energy storage products\nin January 2017 and has since begun producing lithium-ion cells for Model 3, we have no other direct experience in the production of lithium-ion cells.\nGiven the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in issues or delays in further ramping and expanding\nproduction at Gigafactory 1. Moreover, we expect that we will need additional production at Gigafactory 1 \nto support vehicle production at Gigafactory\nShanghai in part when we commence Model 3 production there.\n In order to achieve our volume and gross margin targets for Model 3 and the anticipated\nramp in production of energy storage products, we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory 1, which, among other things,\nrequires Panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at significant volumes. Although Panasonic has a long track record of\nproducing high-quality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan, it has limited experience with cell production at Gigafactory 1. In addition, we\nproduce several components for Model 3, such as battery modules incorporating the lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic, and drive units, at Gigafactory\n1. Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity. While we have largely overcome this\nbottleneck after deploying multiple semi-automated lines and improving our original lines, additional bottlenecks may arise as we continue to increase the\nproduction rate. Finally, we have announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1. If we are unable to maintain Gigafactory 1\nproduction, ramp additionally over time as needed, and do so cost-effectively, or if we or Panasonic are unable to attract, hire and retain a substantial number\nof highly skilled personnel, our ability to supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be negatively impacted, which\ncould negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services\ncould be harmed.\nIf our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or\ncertain features of our vehicles, such as full self-driving, take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally restricted, our ability to develop, market\nand sell our products and services could be harmed. For example, the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex\nand may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by vehicle customers have included those related to the\nsoftware for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X. Although we\nattempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may\nnot be to the satisfaction of our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture, we currently have a limited\nframe of reference by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs, powertrains,\nvehicles and energy storage products.

If we are not able to establish\nmanufacturing activities in China and other jurisdictions to minimize the impact of such unfavorable tariffs, duties or costs, or ramp our production\ncapabilities at Gigafactory 1 or other facilities to support such vehicle manufacturing activities, our ability to compete in such jurisdictions, and our\noperating results, business and prospects, will be harmed.\nIf we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles, including Model 3, our financial condition and operating results\nwill suffer.\nWhile we are continuing to and expect in the future to realize cost reductions by both us and our suppliers, there is no guarantee we will be able to\nachieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals, including for the least expensive variant of Model 3 that we ultimately\nexpect to produce, or our other financial targets. We incur significant costs related to procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles,\nassembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. If our efforts to continue to decrease manufacturing costs are not successful, we may incur substantial\ncosts or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities, such as for Model 3 both in the U.S. and\ninternationally. Many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control, such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and\ncomponents, such as lithium, nickel and other components of our battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels. If we are unable to continue to\ncontrol and reduce our manufacturing costs, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed.\n21","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":24}}},{"pageContent":" \nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of materials, in particular for lithium-ion cells, could harm our business.\nWe may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials. Any such increase, supply interruption or\nshortage could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various materials in our business\nincluding aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. The prices for these materials fluctuate, and their\navailable supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased production of\nelectric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors, and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed\nto multiple risks relating to lithium-ion cells. These risks include:\n \n•\nan increase in the cost, or decrease in the available supply, of materials used in the cells;\n \n•\ndisruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers or any issues that may arise with respect to cells\nmanufactured at our own facilities; and\n \n•\nfluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as our battery-cell purchases for Model S and Model X and some raw\nmaterials for cells used in Model 3 and energy storage products are currently denominated in Japanese yen. \nOur business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products. While we\nbelieve several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at\nour own facilities, we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited\nflexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the\nbattery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and\nother economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our\nmaterials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by battery cell suppliers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we\ncannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could\nresult in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating\nresults.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully\ndefend or insure against such claims.\nAlthough we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road, product liability claims, even those without merit, could harm our business,\nprospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face\ninherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers,\nour cars have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury, and such crashes where Autopilot is\nengaged are the subject of significant public attention. We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or\nclaimed failures of new technologies that we are pioneering, including Autopilot in our vehicles. Moreover, as our solar energy systems and energy storage\nproducts generate and store electricity, they have the potential to cause injury to people or property. A successful product liability claim against us could\nrequire us to pay a substantial monetary award. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy\nstorage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative\npublicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. In most\njurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely\nhave to be paid from company funds, not by insurance.\n22","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":25}}},{"pageContent":" \nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries.

There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete. A significant and growing number of\nestablished and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle\nmarket, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and applications. In some cases, such\ncompetitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Most of our current and potential competitors\nhave significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, vehicle sales resources and networks than we do and may be able to devote greater\nresources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products.  In particular, some competitors have also\nannounced plans to compete with us in important and large markets for electric vehicles, such as China. Increased competition could result in lower vehicle\nunit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results. In addition, our Model 3 vehicle faces competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-\nlevel premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.\nThe solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive. We face competition from other manufacturers, developers and installers of solar and\nenergy storage systems, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make\nour products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs. Moreover, solar\npanel and lithium-ion battery prices have declined and are continuing to decline. As we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capabilities, including\nat Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2, future price declines may harm our ability to produce energy storage systems and solar systems at competitive prices.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our industries,\nthen our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially.\nConsumers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and\nother operations will continue in the long term. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing\nbusiness relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must\nmaintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects.\nMaintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors, such as our limited operating history, negative press, customer unfamiliarity\nwith our products, any delays in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of\nelectric vehicles or our other products and services, our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations, and any other\nnegative publicity related to us. Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects,\neven if exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team, could harm our business and make it\nmore difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\n23","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":26}}},{"pageContent":" \nOur plan to generate ongoing growth and demand, including by expanding and optimizing our retail, service and vehicle charging operations, will\nrequire significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales, installations or\nservicing of our products or availability of public charging solutions.\nWe plan to generate ongoing growth and demand, including by globally expanding and optimizing our retail, service and vehicle charging\noperations.

This ongoing global expansion, which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling,\ndelivering, installing and/or servicing our products at scale, and which may pose legal, regulatory, labor, cultural and political challenges that we have not\npreviously encountered, may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are\nanticipating. \nFurthermore, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles will require us to continue to increase the number of our Supercharger stations and\nconnectors significantly in locations throughout the world. If we fail to do so in a timely manner, our customers could become dissatisfied, which could\nadversely affect sales of our vehicles. \nWe will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale, installation\nand service of our products, the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of Superchargers in those jurisdictions, which\ncould take considerable time and expense.

For example, in China, which is a key market for us, certain products such as automobiles manufactured in the U.S. have become subject to a\nrecently increased tariff imposed by the government. While such increase has been temporarily suspended, the tariff could remain in place for an\nundetermined length of time, be further increased in the future and/or lead consumers to postpone or choose another vehicle brand subject to lower tariffs or\nno tariffs.

On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by\nventing smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed the battery pack to\npassively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our\nvehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls or redesign efforts, all of which would be\ntime consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future\nincident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve our vehicles or energy storage products, could\nseriously harm our business.\nIn addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our facilities and are producing high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs\nat Gigafactory 1. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures\nrelated to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or\ninjury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle or energy storage product may\ncause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products. Such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nIf we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual, financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs, our business may\nsuffer.\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We also\ncurrently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada. Under a lease held directly by us, we typically\nreceive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. The\nprofitability of any vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of\nthe leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles,\neconomic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. The leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners to fund\nand grow this program, and screen for and manage customer credit risk. We expect the availability of leasing and other financing options will be important\nfor our vehicle customers. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds, or partners or other external financing sources, and\ncompelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers, we may be unable to grow our sales. Furthermore, if our leasing business grows\nsubstantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do\nnot successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease\ntransactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties, either of which may harm our business.\nMoreover, we have provided resale value guarantees to customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may\nsell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values, as with residual values for leased vehicles, are\nsubject to similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements.

In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In\nNorway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, the 25% value added tax, or the carbon dioxide and weight-\nbased purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny\nfraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from\nsuch programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted. For example, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit that was available in the U.S. for\nthe purchase of our vehicles is being reduced in phases during, and will sunset at the end of, 2019. We believe the first reduction in this tax credit may have\npulled forward some near-term demand in the U.S. into 2018, and could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal\ntax credit. Moreover, in July 2018, a previously available incentive for purchases of Model 3 in Ontario, Canada was cancelled and Tesla buyers in Germany\nlost access to electric vehicle incentives for a short period of time beginning late 2017. In April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available\nincentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Effective March 2016, California\nimplemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers. Such developments could have some\nnegative impact on demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them.\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy\nstorage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in\nour solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as\nrenewable energy adoption rates increase, often without warning. For example, the U.S. federal government currently offers a 30% ITC for the installation of\nsolar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility. The ITC is currently scheduled to decline in phases,\nultimately to 10% for commercial and utility systems and to 0% for customer-owned residential systems by January 2022. Likewise, in jurisdictions where\nnet energy metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the\ngrid in excess of the electric load they use. Several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering, or have\nproposed to do so. Such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive\nfor potential customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for\nour solar and energy storage assets. Additionally, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. could potentially increase the cost, and decrease the\navailability, of renewable energy financing, by reducing the value of depreciation benefits associated with, and the overall investor tax capacity needed to\nmonetize, renewable energy projects. Such changes could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such projects available in the market.\nMoreover, we and our fund investors claim the ITC and certain state incentives in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar and energy\nstorage systems. Although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values, the relevant governmental authorities have audited\nsuch values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in\nadverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.\n26","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":29}}},{"pageContent":" \nAny failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of PV cells and\nmodules, including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York\nrelating to our Gigafactory 2, could result in negative consequences for our business.\nWe own certain PV cell and module manufacturing and technology assets, and a build-to-suit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the\nState University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”).

For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in\ndata connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. We have designed, implemented and tested\nsecurity measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems. However, hackers have\nreportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control\nof, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products.\nWe encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any\nreported and verified vulnerability. Accordingly, we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or\nwill be successful.\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings. In addition,\nregardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that\nour products, their systems or data are capable of being “hacked,” could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results. \nWe have been the subject of such reports in the past.\nWe are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our\nability to operate our manufacturing facilities.\nAs a manufacturing company, including with respect to facilities such as the Tesla Factory, Gigafactory\n \n1 and Gigafactory 2, we are subject to\ncomplex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S. and abroad, including laws relating to the use,\nhandling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. The costs of compliance, including remediating contamination if any is found on our\nproperties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws, may be significant. We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining\npermits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities, which would hinder our operation of these facilities. Such costs\nand delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. Furthermore, any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and\npenalties, remediation costs, third party damages, or a suspension or cessation of our operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\nIt is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union, which can result in higher\nemployee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in\nindustrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although\nwe work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union,\nor we may be required to become a union signatory. The United Automobile Workers (“UAW”) has been engaged in a campaign to organize manufacturing\noperations at Tesla. As part of that campaign, the UAW has filed with the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) a series of unfair labor practice charges\nagainst Tesla on which a hearing recently concluded. We cannot predict the timing of the NLRB’s decision, and an unfavorable outcome for Tesla may have\na negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with\nunionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our\nproducts and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\n29","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":32}}},{"pageContent":" \nOur products and services are subject to substantial regulations, which are evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these\nregulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nMotor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state and local laws. We incur significant costs in complying with\nthese regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations, and any failures to comply could result in\nsignificant expenses, delays or fines. We are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale and service of automobiles\ninternationally. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions, among\nother things, that are often materially different from requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure\nregulatory compliance in those countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to\nmarket entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\nAdditionally, our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driver-assistance features called Autopilot, which help assist drivers with certain tedious and\npotentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but require drivers to remain engaged. There is a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may\napply to self-driving vehicles, which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a\ndriver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay\nproducts or restrict self-driving features and availability, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the\nsolar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity\npricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid, and the sale of electricity generated by third-party owned\nsystems. For example, existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with\ntheir solar energy systems, charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid, adjust electricity rate\ndesigns such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid, restrict us and our customers from transacting\nunder our PPAs or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power, and limit or eliminate net energy metering. If such regulations\nand policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions, or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our\nsolar and energy storage systems are introduced, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products, threaten the\neconomics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions, which could harm\nour business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with various privacy and consumer protection laws to which we are subject could harm the Company.\nOur privacy policy is posted on our website, and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal, state or\ninternational privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines,\ndamages and other costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and in\nparticular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application. For example, in May 2018,\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in\nthe European Union. The GDPR has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Although we take steps to\nprotect the security of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if\nthird parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal\ninformation. A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects, including possible\nfines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand.\n30","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":33}}},{"pageContent":" \nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions, which could adversely affect our brand image and\nfinancial performance.\nAny product recall with respect to our products may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects,\noperating results and financial condition. For example, certain vehicle recalls that we initiated have resulted from various causes, including a component that\ncould prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged, a concern with the firmware in the restraints control module in certain right-hand-drive\nvehicles, industry-wide issues with airbags from a particular supplier, Model X seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a\ncollision, and concerns of corrosion in Model S power steering assist motor bolts. Furthermore, testing of our products by government regulators or industry\ngroups may require us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products. In the future, we may at various\ntimes, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other\nvehicle OEMs, including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers, prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such\nas federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by\nus or our suppliers, could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nSubject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system, battery and drive unit, we provide four-year or 50,000-mile limited\nwarranties for the purchasers of new Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles and either a four-year or 50,000-mile limited warranty or a two-year or 100,000-\nmile maximum odometer limited warranty for the purchasers of used Model S or Model X vehicles certified and sold by us. The limited warranty for the\nbattery and drive unit for new Model S and Model X vehicles covers the drive unit for eight years, as well as the battery for a period of eight years (or for\ncertain older vehicles, 125,000 miles if reached sooner than eight years), although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties\nor Extended Service plans; the limited warranty for used Model S and Model X vehicles does not extend or otherwise alter the terms of the original battery\nand drive unit limited warranty for such used vehicles specified in their original New Vehicle Limited Warranty. For the battery and drive unit on our current\nnew Model 3 vehicles, we offer an eight-year or 100,000-mile limited warranty for our standard or mid-range battery and an eight-year or 120,000-mile\nlimited warranty for our long-range battery, with minimum 70% retention of battery capacity over the warranty period. In addition, customers of new Model S\nand Model X vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to\ncover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50,000 miles.\nFor energy storage products, we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee minimum energy retention levels. For example, we\ncurrently guarantee that each Powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 70 or 80% (depending on the region of installation) of its stated energy capacity after\n10 years, and that each Powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of its first 15 years of use. For our Solar Roof, we\ncurrently offer a warranty on the glass tiles for the lifetime of a customer’s home and a separate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tiles.\nWe also offer extended warranties, availability guarantees and capacity guarantees for periods of up to 20 years at an additional cost at the time of purchase,\nas well as workmanship warranties to customers who elect to have us install their systems.\nFinally, customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under PPAs are covered by warranties equal to the length of the\nagreement term, which is typically 20 years. Systems purchased for cash are covered by a workmanship warranty of up to 20 years. In addition, we pass\nthrough to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties, which generally range from 10 to 25 years. Finally, we provide a performance\nguarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production\nguarantees set forth in their lease.  Under these performance guarantees, we bear the risk of production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel\nfailure.  These risks are exacerbated in the event the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.\n31","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":34}}},{"pageContent":" \nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\nresults could be materially and adversely affected.

These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such\nestimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products such as Model 3 and Solar Roof\nthat we have recently introduced and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our\nwarranty reserves in the future.\nOur insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us,\nfor which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some\ncases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, and we cannot\nbe certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us.

Upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes, we\nwill be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on\nsuch Tesla Convertible Notes.

The\navailability of this financing depends upon many factors, including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry, the quality and mix of our\ncustomer contracts, any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts, changes in law (including tax law), risks or\ngovernment incentives associated with these financings, and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of\npotential investors. Moreover, while interest rates remain at low levels, they have risen in recent periods. If the rate of return required by investors rises as a\nresult of a rise in interest rates, it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying, and therefore the total value of, our financing\nstructures, increasing our cost of capital. If we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for third-party ownership arrangements, we may\nbe unable to finance the installation of our solar energy systems for our lease or PPA customers’ systems, or our cost of capital could increase and our\nliquidity may be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental\ninvestigations and proceedings.\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in \nNote 17, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n. Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musk’s\nstatement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any\nwrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to\nliability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action\nin the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any\ngovernmental proceedings.\nFor example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a\nsettlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s statement on August 7, 2018\nthat he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an\nindependent director as the Chair of the Board, appointed two additional independent directors to the Board, and made further enhancements to our\ndisclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the\nsettlement, if there is a lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.\nIf we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected, we may have to shorten the useful lives of any\nequipment to be retired as a result of any such update, and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial\nresults.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling, machinery and other manufacturing\nequipment for our various product lines, and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives. However, manufacturing technology\nmay evolve rapidly, and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cutting-edge equipment more quickly than expected. Moreover, we are\ncontinually implementing learnings as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase, which may result in our ability to manufacture\nour products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp production of Model 3 to higher levels, our learnings may cause us to\ndiscontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early\nas a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n34","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":37}}},{"pageContent":" \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. As we have increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside of\nthe U.S., we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone.\nAny strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced. In addition, a portion\nof our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen. If we do not have\nfully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S.\ndollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. Moreover, while we undertake limited hedging activities\nintended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact. As a result, our operating results could be\nadversely affected.\nWe may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric\nvehicles.\nWe sell our vehicles directly to consumers using means that we believe will maximize our reach, currently including through our website and our\nown stores. While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in each\nstate in the U.S., as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. In certain states in which we\nare not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have opened galleries, which are not full sales locations.\nThe application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer\nlicenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so.\nIn addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions\ncomply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief\nthat state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer\nassociations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have\npassed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. We\nhave also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state’s prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business.\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict\nour sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change\nover time.

Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $387.46 per share and a low of $244.59 per share over\nthe last 52 weeks. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our\ncommon stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further\ninfluencing volatility in its market price. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like\nus that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of\nvolatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against\nthese companies. Moreover, stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past. While we are continuing to defend such actions vigorously,\nany judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as\nanticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future\nevents is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those\nrelating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and\ncommodity costs, and planned cost reductions. If our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the\nimpact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline\nsignificantly.\n36","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":39}}},{"pageContent":" \nTransactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our\ncommon stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing\nstockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes.

We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully\nelectric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation and other services related to\nour products.\nAutomotive\nOur production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV, which are our highest-performance vehicles, and our\nModel 3, a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options, internet\nconnectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. In addition, we have several future\nelectric vehicles in our product pipeline, including Model Y, Tesla Semi, a pickup truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster.\nIn 2018, we continued to scale our automotive operations, particularly our ramp of Model 3, and achieved total production of 254,530 vehicles and\ndelivered 245,506 vehicles, representing year-over-year increases of approximately 152% and 138%, respectively.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe lease and sell retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers, and are ramping our Solar\nRoof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive, integrated styling. Our energy storage products, which we manufacture at Gigafactory 1,\nconsist of Powerwall, mostly for residential applications, and Powerpack, for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications.\nDuring 2018, we deployed 1.04 GWh of energy storage products, nearly tripling our 358 MWh of energy storage deployments during 2017. We also\ndeployed 326 megawatts (“MW”) of solar energy generation during 2018.\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2019 Outlook\nAutomotive Demand, Production and Deliveries\nOur goal is to produce the world’s highest quality vehicles as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible with a priority on workplace health and\nsafety. The worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and self-driving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become\neven more so. A growing number of companies, including established automakers, have announced plans to expand, and in some cases fully transition to,\nproduction of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles, and/or to develop self-driving technologies. However, we believe that the unique features of our\nvehicles, the safety aspects of each of our vehicles, our constant innovation, our growing brand, the increased affordability introduced with Model 3, the\ninnovation and expansion of our global retail, service and charging operations and infrastructure and our future vehicles will continue to generate\nincremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets.\n42","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":45}}},{"pageContent":" \nModel 3 was the best-selling premium vehicle in the United States in 2018. Vehicles traded in to us by Model 3 customers continue to suggest the\nexistence of a wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owners of mid-sized premium sedans. Moreover, as we have offered only the long-range,\nmid-range and performance variants of Model 3 thus far, we believe that we will see increased demand with the introduction of less expensive variants, such\nas a version with a base price of $35,000 that we intend to offer in the future, and additional financing options. We commenced in January 2019 production\nof Model 3 for Europe and China, each of which we believe has a much larger mid-sized premium sedan market than North America, where we have\nexclusively delivered Model 3 to date. We also believe that we have an advantage over our competitors with respect to our battery and powertrain\ntechnology, as our vehicles’ EPA-rated range per kWh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicles to be introduced in the near term, and we\nhave the ability to improve our vehicles through over-the-air software updates. We are producing variants (including regional versions) of Model 3 in\naccordance with the demand that we expect for them, however, and we have finite production capabilities with long lead times associated with procuring\ncertain parts. If our Model 3 demand expectations prove inaccurate or we experience delays in introducing planned additional variants, including as we\nbegin offering Model 3 in new markets, we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce.\nWe may also be impacted by trade policies, political uncertainty and \neconomic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations.\nSales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust\nour operations and retail strategies.\n In addition, the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in the U.S. was reduced to $3,750 for any\nTesla vehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of 2019, and will be further reduced to $1,875 for each Tesla vehicle delivered in the third or fourth\nquarter of 2019 and to $0 for each Tesla vehicle delivered thereafter. We believe that this phase-out likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into 2018\nand could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit. In the long run, we do not expect a meaningful\nimpact to our sales in the U.S., as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a compelling proposition even without incentives. Globally, we are also\nworking to, and in some cases have already begun to, increase the value proposition and affordability of our offerings to customers and offer other financing\narrangements over time. For example, we intend to introduce leasing options for Model 3.\nOur Model 3 production ramped dramatically during 2018, and we expect to continue to grow Model 3 production to a sustained rate of 7,000\nvehicles per week at our Tesla Factory by the end of 2019 as we ramp international deliveries.  We remain focused on further cost improvements and on\nincreasing the affordability of Model 3. Furthermore, in January 2019 we commenced construction of our Gigafactory Shanghai in China. We expect to build\na production process that is optimized and simplified for Model 3 production, comprised of stamping, body joining and paint shops and general assembly, at\nGigafactory Shanghai to begin production of \ncertain trims of Model 3\n for China by the end of 2019. We believe that the efficiencies of local production, as\nwell as avoiding certain tariffs on U.S.-manufactured vehicles, will allow us to offer Model 3 at a lower average selling price in the largest market for electric\nvehicles in the world. Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai, our goal is to be able to produce 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis, and an\nannualized output rate in excess of 500,000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. However, the\ntimeframe for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of\ninstalling production equipment and bringing the factory online. Ultimately, achieving increased Model 3 production cost-effectively will require that we\ntimely address any additional bottlenecks that may arise as we continue to ramp, and establish sustained supplier capacity, including locally at Gigafactory\nShanghai.\nWe also recently discontinued new custom orders for the 75 kWh versions of Model S and Model X to focus on longer range versions of our highest-\nperformance flagship vehicles and further differentiate them from Model 3. We have gradually increased the level of option standardization across these\nmodels, and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed us to reduce the production hours for them while preserving the flexibility\nto increase output as necessary. As Model S and Model X are produced in the U.S., for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duties\non components sourced from China, as well as by tariffs on vehicles exported to China, although we intend to partially divert such deliveries to North\nAmerica and Europe, if necessary.\n43","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":46}}},{"pageContent":" \nAdvancing our customer-facing infrastructure remains a top priority. Delivering vehicles to our customers and the related logistics were challenging\nduring 2018, but we continue to improve these processes to maximize customer satisfaction, including by purchasing our own car-hauling trucks. We are also\nexpanding our servicing capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet, including by growing our service locations and Mobile Service fleet,\nmoving to two-shift operations at service centers where needed, and optimizing our parts distribution network. We are also updating the Tesla mobile app for\nscheduling service appointments in order to increase customer convenience. As sales of Tesla vehicles ramp further, we plan to continue to open new Tesla\nretail locations, service centers and body shops around the world, and we plan to continue to expand our Mobile Service fleet. We also plan to continue to\nsignificantly increase the number of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally, as well as evolve our Supercharger technology to enable\nfaster charging times while reducing our related costs. However, we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver an increasing\nnumber of vehicles, and we have only limited experience with this at scale, particularly in markets outside of North America. Moreover, if our growing fleet\nof customer vehicles, particularly Model 3, experiences unexpected reliability issues, it could overburden our servicing capabilities.\n \nFinally, we are making progress with our self-driving technology, as well as the Autopilot features in our vehicles. Our neural net and functionality\ncontinue to improve, and we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release key version updates. Recently, we launched a “Navigate\non Autopilot” feature that allows enabled Tesla vehicles under appropriate circumstances and driver input to change lanes, transition between freeways and\nexit freeways. While we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control, our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy.  Additionally,\nthere is growing competition from other automobile and technology companies in the area of self-driving.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\nWe are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products, transitioning away from former channel partners and\nshifting our sales strategy significantly to sell these products in Tesla stores and on our website and through cross-selling opportunities to our expanding\nbase of vehicle owners.  As we continue to implement this strategy, we expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will decrease slightly before\nstabilizing and growing in the second half of the year, including through cross-selling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners. Our emphasis\nfor retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront cash generation and profitability, rather than absolute volume growth, such as by\nreducing the mix of leased systems and prioritizing residential installations that are combined with our energy storage products.\nWe are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our Solar Roof product, and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with the\nexpectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019.\nWe expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth, and we are targeting to more than double our deployments to\nover 2 GWh in 2019. We see opportunities in North America as well as in Australia and Europe, where energy storage coupled with solar generation may\nmitigate typically higher electricity rates, as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability. We are continuing to ramp production for these products at\nGigafactory 1, including through a new production line, and we have seen further manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes\nas we ramp.\nTrends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses\nCapital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $2.5 billion, mostly to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at\nGigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, and the addition of manufacturing capacity\nfor Model Y, which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020, as well as the ongoing expansion of our retail locations, service centers, body shops,\nMobile Service fleet, and Supercharger stations.\nGenerally, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected revenues and as\nwe focus on increasing operational efficiency. In addition, due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational efficiency, we expect operating\nexpenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10% from 2018.\n44","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":47}}},{"pageContent":" \nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving market\ncapitalization and operational milestones (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). Consequently, we may incur significant additional non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting.\nAutomotive Financing Options\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial\ninstitutions. \nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through\none of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners.\nCurrently, both programs are available only in certain international markets.\n Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following\nDecember 31, 2018 totaled $149.7 million in value.\nWe have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This impacts the way we account for vehicle sales with a\nresale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, which now generally qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return. In\naddition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018, we have ceased recognizing lease\nrevenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach.\nVehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for\nthe vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to\nus, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned\nto us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used vehicles in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows.\nTo date, we have only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us. Based on\ncurrent market demand for our vehicles, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts, but resale\nprices may inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new\nvehicles. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially.\nWe currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada\n. We also offer leasing through leasing\npartners in certain jurisdictions. Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk. In addition, for\nleases offered directly from our captive financing entities, we assume customer credit risk. We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings, including\nour lease financing options and the financial sources to support them, and to support the overall financing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are\nunable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive, our sales, financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Financing Options\nWe offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce\nthrough various contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements include long-term leases and PPAs. In both structures, we install our solar energy\nsystems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee. In the lease structure, this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production\nguarantee. In the PPA structure, we charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually\nproduces. The leases and PPAs are typically for 20 years with a renewal option, and the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations.\nFor customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems, we also offer solar loans, whereby a third-party lender provides financing directly\nto a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed, installed and serviced by us. We enter into a standard\nsolar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer. Separately, the customer enters into a loan agreement with a third-party lender, who\nfinances the full purchase price. We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no\nrecourse against us with respect to the loan.\n45","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":48}}},{"pageContent":" \nGigafactory 1\nWe continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells,\nmodules, battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products. We also continue to invest in the future expansion of\nGigafactory 1 and in additional production capacity there. For example, we have announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1.\nPanasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with\nbattery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As these terms\nconvey to us the right to use, as defined in ASC 840, \nLeases\n, their production equipment, we consider them to be leased assets when production commences.\nThis results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a\ncorresponding liability recorded to financing obligations. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production\nequipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will apply similar accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $766.6 million on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nWhile we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets, our ultimate ability to do so will require\nus to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp. For example, we have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of\nbattery modules at Gigafactory 1, which negatively affected our production of Model 3. While we continue to resolve such issues at Gigafactory 1 as they\narise, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1\nexceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate.\nGigafactory 2\nWe have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory with the intended capacity to produce at least 1.0 GW of solar\nproducts annually in Buffalo, New York, referred to as Gigafactory 2. In December 2016, we entered into an agreement with Panasonic under which it\nmanufactures custom PV cells and modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and we purchase certain quantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic\nduring the 10-year term.\nThe terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants, and any failure to comply with these\ncovenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the agreement. Although we remain on track\nwith our progress at Gigafactory 2, our expectations as to the cost of building the facility, acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our\nmanufacturing operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits.\nGigafactory Shanghai\nWe are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing\ntransportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S. We broke ground in January 2019, and subject to a\nnumber of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory\nonline, we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019. We expect much of the investment in\nGigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing, supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us. Moreover, we are targeting the\ncapital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory, from which we have\ndrawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai.\nOther Manufacturing\nWe continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities and construct our planned facilities, and continually explore additional\nproduction capacity internationally.\n \n \n46","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":49}}},{"pageContent":" \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that\nwe believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly,\nactual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the\nextent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity\nthan our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nAdoption of new revenue standard\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective\nmethod. The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion, refer to Note 2, \nSummary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAutomotive Segment\nAutomotive Sales Revenue\nAutomotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\nAutomotive sales revenue \nincludes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a\nperformance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and\nover-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such\nas access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and\nrecognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to\nthese other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the\nvehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and full self-driving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related\nto automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options\nand other information that may be available.\nAt \nthe time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related\nto future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or\npayable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other\nobligations such as\n \naccess to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. As our contract\ncosts related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. \nAmounts billed to customers\nrelated to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and \nwe have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\nvehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from\nthe transaction price of automotive contracts.\n47","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":50}}},{"pageContent":" \nAutomotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles\nthrough one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing\npartners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their\nvehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-\ndetermined resale value.\nWith the exception of two programs which are discussed within the \nAutomotive Leasing\n section, we now recognize revenue when control transfers\nupon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant\neconomic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive\nincludes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s\neconomic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with\nautomotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with\nresale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. The two programs that are still\nbeing recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in \nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback\nOption\n and \nVehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable.\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The amount of sale\nproceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest\nbearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, \nLeases\n, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale\nproceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired\nat the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as\noperating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\nIn cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any\nremaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was\nexpensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our\ncounterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified\nthe net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nCalifornia and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that\nstate during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles may earn\nregulatory credits (“ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements.\nSimilar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits\nby one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG\ncredits, on our vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third-parties to purchase our\nregulatory credits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms\ncustomary to the business. \nWe recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing\nparty as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.\n48","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":51}}},{"pageContent":" \nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two\nprograms with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all programs\nwith resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.\nDirect Vehicle Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Currently, the direct\nvehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the U.S. and Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle\ndirectly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-\ndetermined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue.\nWe capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions from\nthe origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the\nrelated lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option\nWe offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees to certain leasing partner sales in the United States.\nThese transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been\ntransferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in\naccordance with ASC 840, \nLeases\n. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally\nrecorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to\nautomotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles\nunder this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive\nleasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is\nclassified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or\npaying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale\nvalue guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option\nperiod, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss\non any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material\nchanges to their estimated values, although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date.\n49","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":52}}},{"pageContent":" \nVehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable\nFor certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect\nthe customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them, we continue to recognize these transactions as\noperating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at\nthe time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles\nunder this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions.

There were no significant changes to the\ntiming or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard.\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized\nover the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services,\nservice plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that\nthese items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the\npoint when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are\nrefundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\nEnergy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and\nlarge commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering,\ndesign, and installation of the system. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that\ncaptures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and\nthe system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready\nobligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\nthe installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are\nperforming installation, when installed and accepted by the customer. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment\nterms customary to the business.\n50","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":53}}},{"pageContent":" \nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation\nof the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized\nover time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Certain large-scale commercial and\nutility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and\ninstallation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility\ngrade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers,\nwhich is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the\nutility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term. Customer payments for\nsuch services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market\ndata for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in\nprocess within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an\noffset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and\nenergy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs\nto obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that\nthe underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may\nreceive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial\nand utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at\ntheir most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in\nthe transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote\nmonitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. \nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease\nrevenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease\nterm, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as\ndeferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted\nfor as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts,\nassuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and\noperations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term.

Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products,\nwhich approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-\ndowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our\nfuture demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This\nrequires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once\ninventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the\nrestoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required.\nA small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nWarranties\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we\nsell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30\nyears. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under\nwarranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future\nclaims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may\ncause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles\nsubject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred.\nThe portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining\nbalance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, automotive sales\nwith resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual. Warranty expense is\nrecorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and our employee stock\npurchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards\nwith only service conditions and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-\npricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require\nsignificant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is\nrecognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is\ngenerally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of\nactual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected forfeitures).\n52","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":55}}},{"pageContent":" \nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting\nschedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of\nperformance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in\ntime that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte\nCarlo simulations.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development\nexpense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision\nfor income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and\njudgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative\npractices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate\nmultinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of\nDecember 31, 2018, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our\nU.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation\nallowance could be materially impacted.\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our\nestimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and\nvarious foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to\naudit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is\nadequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our\nestimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the\nextent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such\ndetermination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred\ntax assets in the period that such determination is made.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition\nof U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of\nforeign earnings. We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets\nand liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our\nnet U.S. deferred tax assets.\n53","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":56}}},{"pageContent":" \nIn December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from\nthe enactment date. As such, in accordance with SAB 118, we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and\nguidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior year.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial\ninterest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \nConsolidation\n, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary\nbeneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain\nattributes associated with our solar energy systems and \nleases under our direct vehicle leasing programs\n. The typical condition for a controlling financial\ninterest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs,\nthrough arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the\npower to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate\na VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary\nbeneficiary of a number of VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements,\nor funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual\nprovisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the\nnoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach\nusing the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance\nsheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would\nhypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their\nrecorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-\nparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions\nbetween the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the\nright to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.\n54","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":57}}},{"pageContent":" \nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the\nfair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition\nare expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in\nan acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and\nany noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Our revenue from non-ZEV regulatory credits generally follows our production and delivery trends as we have long-term contracts with\nexisting customers for the sale of these credits.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of trade-in vehicles, partially offset by lower average\nselling prices for used vehicles sales due to an increase in trade-ins of relatively lower priced non-Tesla vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, there was an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow.

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the\ncarrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted\ndemand.\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses\nrecognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs\nrelated to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.\nCosts of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales \nservices\n, costs to acquire and certify used\nvehicles, and costs for retail merchandise. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead\nassociated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCost of automotive sales revenue increased $6.96 billion, or 104%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a significantly higher volume of Model 3 vehicles deliveries in 2018 and the recognition of $969.8\nmillion of additional cost of automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard. These increases were partially offset by significant\nreductions in Model 3 average costs per unit compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing\ncapacity at lower production volumes in 2017 and other cost efficiencies. Additionally, there were lower overall costs for Model S and Model X cash\ndeliveries from approximately 3,240 fewer units delivered year-over-year and reductions in combined Model S and Model X average costs per unit as a result\nof increased manufacturing efficiencies.\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $219.8 million, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of $624.4 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard, partially\noffset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in\nthe number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period\nwhen compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. When our counterparty retains ownership, the net book value of the leased vehicle of the lease vehicle\nis expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue.\nCost of services and other revenue increased $651.3 million, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service centers, additional service personnel in existing and new\nservice centers, Mobile Service capabilities, parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly\ngrowing fleet of vehicles. Additionally, there was an overall increase in the cost of used vehicle sales from the increased volume of relatively lower priced\nnon-Tesla trade-in vehicles.

The higher proportion of Model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 lowered our\noverall gross margin for total automotive as Model 3 had a lower annualized margin than Model S and Model X due to temporary under-utilization of\nmanufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the\nproduction of Model 3.\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and\n2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above.

Likewise, based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between Model Y and Model 3, we believe that the\nproduction ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster than that of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 at\nFremont.\n Considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point, and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells, as\nwell as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of \nGigafactory\n 1, \nGigafactory 2\n and \nGigafactory Shanghai\n, we currently estimate that capital\nexpenditures will be between $2.5 to $3.0 billion annually for the next two fiscal years.\n  \nMoreover, we expect that the cash we generate from our core\noperations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations  (including the repayment of\n$920.0 million for our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due on March 1, 2019), although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example,\nwe expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China.\nAs always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our\nbusiness.\nWe have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of\nNew York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this\nfacility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default.\nWe expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us\n with adequate\nliquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating\nexpenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and\nSupercharger network. \nWe may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or\nat all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, we had $1.50 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31, 2018, some of\nwhich are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables,\ninventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in financing funds or\nvarious other assets; and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our\ninterests in those leases into the financing funds).

Our operating\ncash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, lease payments directly from customers, customer deposits, sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and\nstorage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee\ncompensation, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\nNet cash from operating activities changed favorably by $2.16 billion to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.10 billion during the year\nended December 31, 2018 from net cash used in operating activities of $60.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This favorable change was\nprimarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $1.60 billion and the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of\n$554.6 million. The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as a result of\nincreased expenditures to support our ramp of Model 3 deliveries and a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily\ndue to the adoption of the new revenue standard, wherein certain vehicle sales to customer or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee were previously\naccounted for as an in-substance operating leases are now accounted for as sales with a right of return upon control transfer. The increase in cash from certain\noperating activities was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory, as a result of increased Model 3 and energy products deliveries\nand production. Additionally, there was a decrease in customer deposits primarily due to Model 3 fulfillments and an increase in other assets as we paid\n$141.3 million for the land use rights for Gigafactory Shanghai.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $63.2 million as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $197.3 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss, excluding non-cash\nexpenses and gains, of $134.1 million. The decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on\nreducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of $773.0 million, the increase in\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expanded, the increase in resale value guarantees of $326.9 million and deferred\nrevenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of $388.4 million primarily\ndue to Model 3 reservations. These increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expanded\nour program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures,\n which were $2.32 billion\nduring 2018, $4.08 billion during 2017 and $1.44 billion during 2016. Capital expenditures during 2018 were $2.10 billion from purchases of property and\nequipment, mainly for Model 3 production and the expansion of our customer support infrastructure, and $218.8 million for the design, acquisition and\ninstallation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers.\n65","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":68}}},{"pageContent":" \nCapital expenditures during 2017 were $3.41 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for Model 3 production and $666.5 million\nfor the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates and, in particular, a\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the\nre-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and\ncash and cash equivalents balances). \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $1.5 million in other income\n(expense), net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, New Taiwan dollar and Canadian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we\nrecognized a net foreign currency loss of $52.3 million in other income (expense), net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, Canadian\ndollar and Norwegian krone.\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the impact these changes would have had on our\nnet income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of $175.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $116.0 million\nat December 31, 2017.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases,\nwe utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical\n10% change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by $8.5 million and $7.6\nmillion, respectively.\n \n \n \n68","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":71}}},{"pageContent":" \nI\nTEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n \nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n \n  \nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n  \n70\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n  \n72\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n  \n73\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\n  \n74\nConsolidated Statements of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Equity\n  \n75\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n  \n76\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n  \n77\n \n \n \n69","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":72}}},{"pageContent":" \nR\neport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have \naudited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity, and of cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also\nhave audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated\nFramework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with\ncustomers in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for \nthese consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our\n audits i\nn accordance \nwith the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial \nstatements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n70","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":73}}},{"pageContent":" \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

\nNote 1 – Overview\nTesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\nmanufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes the Company, manages resource allocations and measures\nperformance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\n \n \nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the\nprovisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, \nConsolidation\n, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the\nprimary beneficiary. We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of\ncertain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial\ninterest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs,\nthrough arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the\npower to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate\na VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary\nbeneficiary of a number of VIEs (see Note \n18\n, \nVariable Interest Entity Arrangements\n). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to\nensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes as a result of the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-18\n, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash\n.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the transaction price of\nproducts and services in arrangements with multiple performance obligations and determining the amortization period of these obligations, significant\neconomic incentive for residual value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value\nof long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, residual value of operating lease vehicles, depreciable lives of property and equipment and\nsolar energy systems, fair value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases, warranty liabilities, income taxes, contingencies, the accrued\nliability for solar energy system performance guarantees, determining lease pass-through financing obligations, the discount rates used to determine the fair\nvalue of investment tax credits, the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets, fair value of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value stock-based compensation.\nIn addition, estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting for business combinations, including the fair values and useful lives of acquired assets,\nassumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\n77","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":80}}},{"pageContent":" \nRevenue \nRecognition\nAdoption of new accounting standards\nASU 2014-09,\n Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Custome\nrs. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective method. As a policy election, the\nnew revenue standard was applied only to contracts that were not substantially completed as of the date of adoption. We recognized the cumulative effect of\ninitially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018 opening balance of accumulated deficit. The prior period consolidated\nfinancial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nA majority of our automotive sales revenue is recognized when control transfers upon delivery to customers. For certain vehicle sales where revenue\nwas previously deferred as an in-substance operating lease, such as certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, we now\nrecognize revenue when the vehicles are shipped as a sale with a right of return. As a result, the corresponding operating lease asset, deferred revenue, and\nresale value guarantee balances as of December 31, 2017, were reclassified to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. Furthermore, the warranty\nliability related to such vehicles has been accrued as a result of the change from in-substance operating leases to vehicle sales. Prepayments on contracts that\ncan be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans, have been reclassified from deferred revenue to customer deposits. Refer to\nthe \nAutomotive Revenue\n and \nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\n sections below for further discussion of the impact on various categories of vehicle sales.\nFollowing the adoption of the new revenue standard, the revenue recognition for our other sales arrangements, including sales of solar energy\nsystems, energy storage products, services, and sales of used vehicles, remained consistent with our historical revenue recognition policy. Under our lease\npass-through fund arrangements, we do not have any further performance obligations and therefore reclassified all investment tax credit (“ITC”) deferred\nrevenue as of December 31, 2017, to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. The corresponding effects of the changes to lease pass-through fund\narrangements are also reflected in our non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. Additionally, we have considered the impact from any new revenue\narrangements in the current year that would have been accounted for differently under ASC 605, \nRevenue Recognition\n, as an adjustment from adoption of the\nnew revenue standard.\n78","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such\nas access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and\nrecognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to\nthese other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the\nvehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and full self-driving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related\nto automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options\nand other information that may be available.\n81","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":84}}},{"pageContent":" \nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related\nto future product returns. Such estimates are\n based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or\npayable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other\nobligations such \nas\n \naccess to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates.\n As our contract\ncosts related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers\nrelated to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\nvehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from\nthe transaction price of automotive contracts.\nAutomotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles\nthrough one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing\npartners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their\nvehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-\ndetermined resale value.\nWith the exception of two programs which are discussed within the \nAutomotive Leasing\n section, we now recognize revenue when control transfers\nupon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant\neconomic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive\nincludes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s\neconomic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with\nautomotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with\nresale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. The two programs that are still\nbeing recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in \nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback\nOption\n and \nVehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable.\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The amount of sale\nproceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. \nFor certain transactions that were considered interest\nbearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, \nLeases\n, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. \nThe remaining sale\nproceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired\nat the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as\noperating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\nIn cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any\nremaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was\nexpensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our\ncounterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified\nthe net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory.\n82","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":85}}},{"pageContent":" \nDeferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air\nsoftware updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following (in thousands):\n \n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2018\n \nDeferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value\n   guarantee— beginning of period (post adoption of new revenue\n   standard)\n \n$\n475,919\n \nAdditions\n \n \n532,294\n \nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\n \n \n(13,248\n)\nRevenue recognized\n \n \n(112,214\n)\nDeferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value\n   guarantee— end of period\n \n$\n882,751\n \nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of\nDecember 31, 2018.

Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees, we expect to recognize $326.7 million of revenue\nin the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in \nAutomotive Sales without Resale Value\nGuarantee\n.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nCalifornia and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that\nstate during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles may earn\nregulatory credits (“ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements.\nSimilar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits\nby one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG\ncredits, on our vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third-parties to purchase our\nregulatory credits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms\ncustomary to the business.\nWe recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive\nrevenue in the consolidated statement of operations.

Currently, the direct\nvehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the U.S. and Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle\ndirectly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-\ndetermined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to \nautomotive leasing revenue\n on a\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $393.2 million, $220.6 million and $112.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we\nhad deferred $109.8 million and $96.6 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the\ncontractual terms of the individual leases.\nWe capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions from\nthe origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the\nrelated lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option\nWe offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States.\nThese transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been\ntransferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in\naccordance with ASC 840, \nLeases\n. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally\nrecorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to\nautomotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles\nunder this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive\nleasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is\nclassified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or\npaying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale\nvalue guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option\nperiod, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue\n. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this\nprogram, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $479.8\n \nmillion as of December 31, 2018, including $309.8\n \nmillion within a 12-month period.\n \nAs of\nDecember 31, 2018\n,\n we had $558.3\n million\n of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and $92.5\n \nmillion recorded in deferred revenue liability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $332.4 million of leasing revenue related to this program.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss\non any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material\nchanges to their estimated values, although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date.\n84","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":87}}},{"pageContent":" \nVehicle\n S\nales\n to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable\nFor certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect\nthe customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them, we continue to recognize these transactions as\noperating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at\nthe time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles\nunder this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale\nproceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized\non a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee\nperiod or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and\ndepreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\nIn cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining\ndeferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of\nautomotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount\nequal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the\nvehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. As of December 31, 2018, $149.7 million of the guarantees were exercisable by\ncustomers within the next 12 months. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $157.9 million of leasing revenue related to this program. \nServices and Other Revenue\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle components to other\nmanufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. There were no significant changes to the timing or amount\nof revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard.\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized\nover the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services,\nservice plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that\nthese items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the\npoint when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are\nrefundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred\nrevenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n \nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\nEnergy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and\nlarge commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering,\ndesign, and installation of the system. Post installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that\ncaptures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and\nthe system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready\nobligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. \nSales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\nthe installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are\nperforming installation, when installed and accepted by the customer. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment\nterms customary to the business.\n85","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":88}}},{"pageContent":" \nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation\nof the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized\nover time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Certain large-scale commercial\nand utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design\nand installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility\ngrade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, \nrevenue is recognized when control\ntransfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate\nfrom the utility for solar energy systems. \nOperations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term. Customer\npayments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market\ndata for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in\nprocess within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an\noffset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and\nenergy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs\nto obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that\nthe underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may\nreceive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial\nand utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at\ntheir most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in\nthe transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote\nmonitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $148.7 million and $124.0 million, respectively. Revenue\nrecognized from the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, was $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have elected the practical\nexpedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales\nwith an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of December 31, 2018, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were\nunsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $117.9 million.

Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more\nlikely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.

The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte\nCarlo simulations (see Note \n15,\n \nEquity Incentive Plans\n).\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development\nexpense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements,\nor funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual\nprovisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the\nnoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach\nusing the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance\nsheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would\nhypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their\nrecorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-\nparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions\nbetween the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the\nright to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to\ncommon stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the\nweighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method\nor the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common\nstockholders when their effect is dilutive.

We provide an allowance against accounts receivable to the amount we\nreasonably believe will be collected. We write-off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible.\nWe typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle\ndelivery, except for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing arrangements between our customers and the financial\ninstitutions.\nMyPower Customer Notes Receivable\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower was offered by SolarCity to provide residential customers\nwith the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for potentially\nuncollectible amounts, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion\nand as MyPower customer notes receivable, net of current portion, for the long-term portion. In determining the allowance and credit quality for customer\nnotes receivable, we identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also consider our historical level of credit losses and current\neconomic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that are individually impaired are charged-off as a write-off of\nthe allowance for losses. Since acquisition, there have been no new significant customers with known disputes or collection issues, and the amount of\npotentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant. In addition, there were no material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of\nDecember 31, 2018.\nConcentration of Risk\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts\nreceivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit\nquality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no entity represented\n10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-\nrated multinational banks.\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary\ncomponents of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these\ncomponents from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products,\nwhich approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-\ndowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our\nfuture demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This\nrequires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once\ninventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the\nrestoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n91","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":94}}},{"pageContent":" \nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required.\nA small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program, vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a\nbuyback option, as well as vehicles delivered to customers with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable are classified as operating lease vehicles as\nthe related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases (refer to the \nAutomotive Leasing Revenue \nsection above for details). Operating lease vehicles\nare recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease term. The total\ncost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2.55 billion and $4.85 billion,\nrespectively. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $457.6 million and $733.3 million, respectively.\nSolar Energy Systems, Leased and To Be Leased\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems under leases that qualify as operating leases. Our leases are accounted for in accordance with ASC 840. To\ndetermine lease classification, we evaluate the lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the\nlease, whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at\nlease inception. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination. Solar energy\nsystems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n \nSolar energy systems leased to customers\n \n \n \n30 to 35 years\nInitial direct costs related to customer\n   solar energy system lease acquisition\n   costs\n \n \n \nLease term (up to 25\nyears)\n \nSolar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending interconnection with the respective utility companies and will be\ndepreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction\nrepresents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they are completed, interconnected\nand leased to customers. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the\nrelated customer lease agreements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally\ncomputed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n \nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and\n   office furniture\n \n \n \n2 to 12 years\nBuilding and building improvements\n \n \n \n15 to 30 years\nComputer equipment and software\n \n \n \n3 to 10 years\n \nDepreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated\nproductive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated productive life for Model S and Model X tooling was 325,000 vehicles based\non our current estimates of production. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated productive life for Model 3 tooling was 1,000,000 vehicles based on our\ncurrent estimates of production.\n92","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":95}}},{"pageContent":" \nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the\nconsolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are\nexpensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably\nover the identified useful life.\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction-in-\nprogress is included within property, plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\nFurthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit\nlease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns or our other commitments under the\narrangements. In these cases, we recognize build-to-suit lease assets under construction and corresponding build-to-suit lease liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheet, in accordance with ASC 840. Once construction is completed, if a lease meets certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we remove the asset and\nliability and account for the lease as an operating lease. Otherwise, the lease is accounted for as a capital lease.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying\namount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted-\ndown to its fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have recognized certain material impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to Note 4,\nIntangible Assets\n, for further details). For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to thirty years.\nCapitalization of Software Costs\nFor costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to\npreliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its\nestimated useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nForeign Currency\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary\ncurrency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the\ndifferent rates we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period income or loss, and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly\naverage functional currency rate to its income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years\nended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of $1.5 million, losses of $52.3 million and gains of $26.1 million,\nrespectively.\n93","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":96}}},{"pageContent":" \nWarranties\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we\nsell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to\n30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under\nwarranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future\nclaims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may\ncause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles\nsubject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred.\nThe portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining\nbalance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, automotive sales\nwith resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual, which is included in the\ntable below.

We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these outputs are being achieved. We evaluate if any amounts are due to our customers and\nmake any payments periodically as specified in the customer agreements. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had recognized a liability of $7.5 million\nand $6.3 million, respectively, within accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets, related to these guarantees based on our assessment of\nthe exposures.\nSolar Renewable Energy Credits\nWe account for solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) when they are purchased by us or sold to third-parties. For SRECs generated by solar\nenergy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental\ncosts incurred to generate the SRECs. For SRECs purchased by us, we record these SRECs at their cost, subject to impairment testing. We recognize revenue\nfrom the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to cost of revenue.\n94","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":97}}},{"pageContent":" \nDeferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue\nWe have solar energy systems that are eligible for ITCs that accrue to eligible property under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Under\nSection 50(d)(5) of the IRC and the related regulations, a lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee as the owner of such property for the\npurposes of claiming the ITCs associated with such property. These regulations enable the ITCs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow\nthe transfer of the ITCs. Under our lease pass-through fund arrangements, we can make a tax election to pass-through the ITCs to the investors, who are the\nlegal lessee of the property. Therefore, we are able to monetize these ITCs to the investors who can utilize them in return for cash payments. We consider the\nmonetization of ITCs to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated with solar energy systems. Consequently, we consider the\nproceeds from the monetization of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy systems.\nIn accordance with the relevant FASB guidance, we recognize revenue from the monetization of ITCs when (1) persuasive evidence of an\narrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related\nreceivable is reasonably assured. An ITC is subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property\nor undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placed-in-service date; the recapture amount decreases on each anniversary of the placed-in-\nservice date. Since we have an obligation to ensure that the solar energy system is in-service and operational for a term of five years in order to avoid any\nrecapture of the ITC, we recognize revenue as the recapture amount decreases, assuming the other revenue recognition criteria above have been met. As a\nresult, the monetized ITC is initially recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently, one-fifth of the monetized ITC is\nrecognized as energy generation and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operations on each anniversary of the solar energy system’s placed-in-\nservice date over five years. As discussed in the \nRevenue Recognition\n section above, following the adoption of the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018,\nwe no longer defer the monetized ITC as deferred revenue outstanding and have reclassified all ITC deferred revenue as of December 31, 2017 to our opening\naccumulated deficit.\nWe indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our non-compliance. We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is\nremote, and consequently, we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNevada Tax Incentives\nWe have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for sales, use, real property,\npersonal property and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits. These incentives are available for the\napplicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2034 (depending on the incentive). Under these\nagreements, we were eligible for a maximum of $195.0 million of transferable tax credits, subject to capital investments by us and our partners for\nGigafactory 1 of at least $3.50 billion, which we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1, which we exceeded during 2018. We\nrecord these credits as earned when we have evidence there is a market for their sale. Credits are applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to\ncapital assets, depending on the source of the credits. Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our partners at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as\na reduction to operating expenses. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had earned $195.0 million and $163.0 million of transferable tax credits under\nthese agreements, respectively.\n95","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":98}}},{"pageContent":" \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, to replace the\nexisting revenue recognition criteria for contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, \nDeferral of the Effective Date\n, to defer\nthe effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,\nPrincipal versus Agent Considerations\n, ASU No. 2016-10, \nIdentifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\n, ASU No. 2016-11, \nRescission of SEC\nGuidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting\n, ASU\nNo. 2016-12, \nNarrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\n, and ASU No. 2016-20, \nTechnical Corrections and Improvements\n, to clarify and amend\nthe guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to\naccumulated deficit. The adoption of the ASUs changed the timing of revenue recognition to be at delivery for certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing\npartners with a resale value guarantee, which now qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the prior accounting as operating\nleases or collateralized lease borrowings. Upon adoption of the ASUs, we recorded a decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit of $623.2 million\nincluding income tax effects, which were immaterial. Refer to the \nRevenue Recognition\n section above for details.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \nLeases\n, to require lessees to recognize all leases, with limited exceptions, on the balance sheet,\nwhile recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease accounting. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and\nmodifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10\n, Codification Improvements to Topic 842\n, ASU No. 2018-11,\nTargeted Improvements\n,\n \nand ASU No. 2018-20,\n Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors\n, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. The ASUs\nare effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2019\non a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated deficit balance. Prior comparative periods will not be\nrestated under this method, and we will adopt all available practical expedients, as applicable. Further, solar leases that commence on or after January 1,\n2019, where we are the lessor and which are currently accounted for as leases, will no longer meet the definition of a lease. Instead, solar leases commencing\non or after January 1, 2019 will be accounted for under ASC 606. In addition to recognizing operating leases that were previously not recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheet, we also expect most of our build-to-suit leases to be de-recognized with a net decrease of approximately of $100.0 million to our\nbeginning accumulated deficit before income tax effects, as our build-to-suit leases will no longer qualify for build-to-suit accounting and will instead be\nrecognized as operating leases or finance leases. Upon adoption, our consolidated balance sheet will include an overall reduction in assets in the range of\napproximately $400.0 million to $500.0 million and a reduction in liabilities in the range of approximately $500.0 million to $600.0 million. The ASUs are\nnot expected to have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, to require financial assets carried at\namortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, \nCodification Improvements to Topic 326\n, to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease\naccounting standards. The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of\nthe ASUs is modified retrospective. We are currently obtaining an understanding of the ASUs and plan to adopt them on January 1, 2020.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \nClassification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\n, to reduce the diversity in practice\nwith respect to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for interim and annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which did not have a material\nimpact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,\n Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash\n, which requires entities to present the aggregate\nchanges in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, the statement of cash flows now\npresents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as a part of the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for\ninterim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which\nresulted in restricted cash being combined with unrestricted cash reconciling beginning and ending balances.

We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair\nvalue on the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other long-term liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income\n(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash\nflows.

Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert, at their option,\non or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to March 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1)\nduring any quarter beginning after September 30, 2013, if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive)\nduring the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the five-\nbusiness day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2018 Notes is less than 98% of the product of the\nclosing price of our common stock for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our\ncommon stock or if specified corporate transactions occur.

We received\n$120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are\nintended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48\nper share.

The maximum conversion rate is capped at 2.3635 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the\nconvertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $423.10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash\nconversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined\nfundamental changes.\nIn November 2018, the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 matured and aggregate outstanding principal of $230.0 million was fully paid\noff.\n1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019\nIn September 2014, SolarCity issued $500.0 million and in October 2014, SolarCity issued an additional $66.0 million in aggregate principal\namount of 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2019 in a private placement.\nEach $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a\nconversion price of $759.36 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers).\nThe maximum conversion rate is capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum\nconversion price of $573.10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us\nto repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes.\nIn connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September and October 2014, SolarCity entered into capped call option agreements\nto reduce the potential dilution upon the conversion of the convertible senior notes. Specifically, upon the exercise of the capped call options, we would now\nreceive shares of our common stock equal to 745,377 shares multiplied by (a) (i) the lower of $1,146.18 or the then market price of our common stock less (ii)\n$759.36 and divided by (b) the then market price of our common stock. The results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market price\nof our common stock exceeds $759.36 and approaches $1,146.18, but we would receive less shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds\n$1,146.18. Consequently, if the convertible senior notes are converted, then the number of shares to be issued by us would be effectively partially offset by\nthe shares received by us under the capped call options. We can also elect to receive the equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares. The capped call options\nexpire on various dates ranging from September 4, 2019 to October 29, 2019, and the formula above would be adjusted in the event of a merger; a tender\noffer; nationalization; insolvency; delisting of our common stock; changes in law; failure to deliver; insolvency filing; stock splits, combinations, dividends,\nrepurchases or similar events or an announcement of certain of the preceding actions. Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued after a\nconversion of the convertible senior notes, the capped call options were separately negotiated transactions, are not a part of the terms of the convertible\nsenior notes, do not affect the rights of the convertible senior note holders and take effect regardless of whether the convertible senior notes are actually\nconverted. The capped call options meet the criteria for equity classification because they are indexed to our common stock and we always control whether\nsettlement will be in shares or cash.\n113","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":116}}},{"pageContent":" \nZero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020\nIn December 2015, SolarCity issued $113.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due on December 1,\n2020 in a private placement. $13.0 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related parties (see Note 21, \nRelated Party Transactions\n).\nEach $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 3.3333 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a\nconversion price of $300.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers).\nThe maximum conversion rate is capped at 4.2308 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum\nconversion price of $236.36 per share.

If additional operational milestones become probable, stock-based compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes\nprobable including cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided since the grant date. The market capitalization milestone period and the valuation\nof each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and is used as the basis for determining the expected achievement period. The probability of\nmeeting an operational milestone is based on a subjective assessment of our future financial projections. Even though no tranches of the 2018 CEO\nPerformance Award vest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational milestone are both achieved, stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized only when an operational milestone is considered probable of achievement regardless of how much additional market capitalization must be\nachieved in order for a tranche to vest. At our current market capitalization, even the first tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will not vest unless\nour market capitalization were to approximately double from the current level and stay at that increased level for a sustained period of time.

The excess tax\nbenefits result in an increase to our gross U.S. deferred tax assets that is offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance.\n(2)\nDue to the Tax Act, our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were re-measured from 35% to 21%. The change in tax rate\nresulted in a decrease to our gross U.S. deferred tax assets which is offset by a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $7.30 billion of federal and $5.37 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable\nincome, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2028 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity\nprior to our acquisition in 2016 and, therefore, are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be\nutilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had research and development tax credits of $256.1 million and $276.2 million for federal and state income tax\npurposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state\nresearch and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $126.8 million for federal\nincome tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.\nCollectively, we had no foreign earnings as of December 31, 2018 and therefore was not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax provisions of the\nTax Act. However, some of our foreign subsidiaries do have accumulated earnings. No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been\nrecorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the\nunrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.\nFederal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an\n“ownership change”, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the\nutilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.\n128","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":131}}},{"pageContent":" \nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2015\n \n$\n99,127\n \nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n \n \n28,677\n \nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\n   positions\n \n \n62,805\n \nAssumed uncertain tax positions through acquisition\n \n \n13,327\n \nDecember 31, 2016\n \n \n203,936\n \nDecrease in balances related to prior year tax positions\n \n \n(31,493\n)\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\n   positions\n \n \n84,352\n \nChange in balances related to effect of U.S. tax law\n   change\n \n \n(58,050\n)\nDecember 31, 2017\n \n \n198,745\n \nDecrease in balances related to prior year tax positions\n \n \n(6,347\n)\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\n   positions\n \n \n60,960\n \nDecember 31, 2018\n \n$\n253,357\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were\nimmaterial.

However, we\ncannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.  \nThe U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in \nAltera Corp v.

The complaint alleges misrepresentations\nmade by Tesla regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of 2017 in connection with such offering, and seeks\nunspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed\nthe case to federal court.  On January 22, 2019, plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court, instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla,\nElon Musk and seven initial purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California who is\nhearing the above-referenced earlier filed federal court case.  On February 5, 2019, the Court stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss\nthe complaint in the above earlier filed case.

We are unable\nto estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and\nthe members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based\ncompensation plan. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On\nAugust 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018 and defendants filed a reply\nbrief on December 13, 2018.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss is set for May 9, 2019.  We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit\nand intend to defend against them vigorously.\nSecurities Litigation related to Potential Going Private Transaction\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection\nwith Elon Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are now pending in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal\nsecurities laws related to Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of\nTesla’s securities. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of\ndirectors.  Defendants plan to file a motion to dismiss the complaint on or before March 7, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss is tentatively set for\nJune 20, 2019.  We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss, or range\nof loss, associated with these claims.\nBetween October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the\nmembers of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction.  These\ncases have been stayed pending resolution of the stockholder class action.  In addition to these cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was\nfiled in federal court in Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted, and the parties have agreed to also\nstay this case pending resolution of the stockholder class action; the parties’ proposed stipulation regarding the stay is pending with the Court.

The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated\nwith these claims.\nSettlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction\nOn October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed\nwith the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to Elon\nMusk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. Without admitting or denying any of the SEC’s allegations, and with no restriction on\nMr. Musk’s ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other than as its Chair), among other things, we and Mr. Musk paid civil penalties of $20\nmillion each and agreed that\n \nan independent director will serve as Chair of the Board for at least three years, and we appointed such an independent Chair of\nthe Board and two additional independent directors to the Board, and further enhanced our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related\nmatters.\n \n132","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":135}}},{"pageContent":" \nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\nWe receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the\nNational Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state, federal and international agencies. We routinely\ncooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests.\nIn particular, the SEC has issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Mr. Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private\nand (b) certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production. The DOJ has\nalso asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about each of these matters and is investigating. Aside from the settlement with the SEC relating to\nMr. Musk’s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to\nour knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been\ncooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the\ngovernment decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects,\ncash flows, and financial position.\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or\ndevelopment were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial\nposition and brand\n.\nIndemnification and Guaranteed Returns\nWe are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting\nfrom reductions in U.S. Treasury grants or ITCs. Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy\nsystems as assessed by the U.S. Treasury Department for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or\nU.S. Treasury grants. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this\nobligation based on all the information available at that time, including any guidelines issued by the U.S. Treasury Department on solar energy system\nvaluations for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess\nof the amounts already recognized by us, which were immaterial, for this obligation are not probable based on the facts known at the filing date.\nThe maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of\nthe solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the U.S. Treasury Department would determine as fair value\nfor the systems for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming\nITCs or U.S. Treasury grants. We claim U.S. Treasury grants based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from\nthe IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs\nthat are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine future revisions to U.S. Treasury Department guidelines governing\nsolar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the\nmaximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date.\nWe are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can\nbe claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one\nstate’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives\nreceived are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to\nindemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received.\nOur lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in\na fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors. Any refunds of master lease\nprepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.\n133","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":136}}},{"pageContent":" \nLetters of Credit\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2018\n, we had $219.6\n \nmillion of unused letters of credit outstanding.\n \n \nNote 18 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our \nsolar energy systems and vehicles.

These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding\n25 years. These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, net on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.05 billion and\n$1.09 billion, respectively. The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $66.1 million and $30.9 million,\nrespectively. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2018 was $111.9 million, of which $61.8 million was classified as a\ncurrent liability. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2017 was $134.8 million, of which $67.3 million was classified as a\ncurrent liability. Lease pass-through financing obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other for the current portion and other long-term liabilities for\nthe long-term portion on the consolidated balance sheet.\nUnder a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some\ncases, subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs, which is estimated by\ndiscounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is accounted for separately (see Note 2, \nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\n). We account for the remainder of the investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through\nfinancing obligation, which is repaid from the future customer lease payments and any incentive rebates.

Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13.3 million (see Note 4, \nIntangible Assets\n).\nIn October 2018, a final court order was entered approving the terms of a settlement in connection with the SEC’s legal actions relating to Elon\nMusk’s prior consideration during the third quarter of 2018 of a take-private proposal for Tesla. Consequently, we recognized settlement and legal expenses\nof $30.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 17, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n). These expenses were substantially paid by the end of\n2018.\n \n \nNote 24 – Subsequent Events\nOn February 3, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (“Maxwell”). Pursuant to the definitive\nagreement, each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of our common stock equal to the lesser\nof: (i) $4.75 divided by an average value of one share of our common stock as calculated pursuant to the definitive agreement, and (ii) 0.0193, provided that\ncash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock. The closing of the transaction is subject to the successful tender of a specified\nminimum number of Maxwell common stock in an exchange offer to be commenced by our wholly-owned subsidiary, certain regulatory approvals and\ncustomary closing conditions.\n \n \nNote 25 – Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents selected quarterly results of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per\nshare amounts):\n \n \n \nThree Months Ended\n \n \n \nMarch 31\n \n \nJune 30\n \n \nSeptember 30\n \n \nDecember 31\n \n2018\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal revenues\n \n$\n3,408,751\n \n \n$\n4,002,231\n \n \n$\n6,824,413\n \n \n$\n7,225,873\n \nGross profit\n \n$\n456,526\n \n \n$\n618,930\n \n \n$\n1,523,665\n \n \n$\n1,442,900\n \nNet (loss) income attributable to common\n   stockholders\n \n$\n(709,551\n)\n \n$\n(717,539\n)\n \n$\n311,516\n \n \n$\n139,483\n \nNet (loss) income per share of common stock\n   attributable to common stockholders, basic\n \n$\n(4.19\n)\n \n$\n(4.22\n)\n \n$\n1.82\n \n \n$\n0.81\n \nNet (loss) income per share of common stock\n   attributable to common stockholders, diluted\n \n$\n(4.19\n)\n \n$\n(4.22\n)\n \n$\n1.75\n \n \n$\n0.78\n \n2017\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal revenues\n \n$\n2,696,270\n \n \n$\n2,789,557\n \n \n$\n2,984,675\n \n \n$\n3,288,249\n \nGross profit\n \n$\n667,946\n \n \n$\n666,615\n \n \n$\n449,140\n \n \n$\n438,786\n \nNet loss attributable to common\n   stockholders\n \n$\n(330,277\n)\n \n$\n(336,397\n)\n \n$\n(619,376\n)\n \n$\n(675,350\n)\nNet loss per share of common stock\n   attributable to common stockholders, basic\n \n$\n(2.04\n)\n \n$\n(2.04\n)\n \n$\n(3.70\n)\n \n$\n(4.01\n)\nNet loss per share of common stock\n   attributable to common stockholders, diluted\n \n$\n(2.04\n)\n \n$\n(2.04\n)\n \n$\n(3.70\n)\n \n$\n(4.01\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n138","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":141}}},{"pageContent":" \nI\nTEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone\nI\nTEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation as of December 31, 2018, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective to provide reasonable assurance.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we further enhanced our disclosure controls in accordance with the September 29, 2018 settlement with the SEC\nregarding Elon Musk’s social media posts on August 7, 2018.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated\nFramework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2018, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31,\n2018, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nI\nTEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nNone\n \n \n \n139","metadata":{"source":"docs/input/tesla/TSLA_2018.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Creator":"Morningstar Document Research / Morningstar, Inc.","Producer":"PDFlib+PDI 7.0.1 (Linux-x86_64)","CreationDate":"D:20190509182229-05'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":418},"loc":{"pageNumber":142}}},{"pageContent":" \nP\nART III\nI\nTEM 10.\nDIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe information required by this Item 10 of Form 10-K will be included in our 2019 Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission in connection with the solicitation of proxies for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.
