For  example,  Congress  has  declared  that  part  of  a  school’s \njob is educating students about the dangers of drug abuse, see, \ne. g., \nthe \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994, and petition­\ners and many other schools have adopted policies aimed at implementing \nthis  message.    Student  speech  celebrating  illegal  drug  use  at  a  school \nevent,  in  the  presence  of  school  administrators  and  teachers,  poses  a \nparticular  challenge  for  school  officials  working  to  protect  those  en­\ntrusted to their care.

At least two interpretations of the \nwords  on  the  banner  demonstrate  that  the  sign  advocated \nthe  use  of  illegal  drugs.    First,  the  phrase  could  be  inter­\npreted  as  an imperative:  “[Take]  bong  hits  . .  .  ”—a  message \nequivalent, as  Morse explained in her  declaration, to “smoke \nmarijuana”   or   “use   an   illegal   drug.”    Alternatively,   the \nphrase  could  be  viewed  as  celebrating  drug  use—“bong  hits \n[are a good thing],” or “[we take] bong hits”—and we discern \nno  meaningful  distinction  between  celebrating  illegal  drug \nuse  in  the  midst  of  fellow  students  and  outright  advocacy  or \npromotion.
